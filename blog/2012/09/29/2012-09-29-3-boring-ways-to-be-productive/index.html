            <p>What do President Obama and Facebook <span class="caps">CEO</span> Mark Zuckerburg have in common? They both wear basically the <a href="http://www.vanityfair.com/politics/2012/10/michael-lewis-profile-barack-obama">same</a> <a href="http://www.quora.com/Mark-Zuckerberg-1/Why-does-Mark-Zuckerberg-always-wear-the-same-shirt">outfit</a> every day. When asked why, both have similar answers, &#8220;it&#8217;s one less decision I have to make in a day.&#8221;&nbsp;[1,2]</p>
<p><a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/74/5/1252/">Studies</a> <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Honest-Truth-About-Dishonesty-Everyone-Especially/dp/0062183591">have</a> <a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/94/5/883/">shown</a> that making decisions, even tiny ones, deplete your mental energy for the more important ones [3,4,5]. Even choosing between candy bars takes away from the energy you could have used to solve a crucial&nbsp;problem!</p>
<p>To put as much of my non-career life on autopilot, here are three habits I&#8217;ve formed that help me increase my&nbsp;productivity.</p>
<h1>No. 1: Pick out your clothes and pack your bag the night&nbsp;before</h1>
<p>To follow Obama and Zuckerburg, don&#8217;t waste your energy on picking what you put on your body. What matters is that it&#8217;s appropriate and that you&#8217;re&nbsp;clothed.</p>
<p>Yes, this is something a parent would say to their child, but it works! By the end of the day my brain is usually pretty drained, but doing something semi-mindless like putting my keys and wallet back into my bag is usually fine. I check the weather for the next day and asses my outfit situation. In the morning, I don&#8217;t want to be wasting my time thinking about whether my bag is ready or not &#8212; I want to <em>go!</em></p>
<p>In Southern California, this is usually &#8220;short sleeves or long?&#8221; But when I was in school in Boston, checking tomorrow&#8217;s weather answered the more serious question of whether I needed snow boots or&nbsp;not.</p>
<h1>No. 2: Exercise (almost) every day, at the same&nbsp;time</h1>
<p>While I&#8217;m a morning person, exercising in the morning was completely repulsive to me! That&#8217;s when my mind is the most fresh and when I can accomplish the most. Exercising in the morning is my body stealing time away from my mind. Until I realized I could work both my mind <em>and</em> body in the morning! The author of <a href="http://joel.is/post/24064139389/the-exercise-habit">this blog post</a> wakes up at 5:50am, works for an hour, then goes to the gym 7am-8am, then comes home, has breakfast, and goes on with his day. (Obama)[] also touts the virtues of daily&nbsp;exercise.</p>
<p>I experimented with this schedule of waking up, working, exercising, then getting on with the day. The difference in productivity on the days I worked out and the days I didn&#8217;t was amazing. The days I worked out, I&#8217;d get almost 6 hours of serious mental work in. When I didn&#8217;t, I&#8217;d only truly work for about three&nbsp;hours.</p>
<p>So I decided to keep doing this, and now I&#8217;m waking up at  4:50am every weekday, working, then exercising 6am-7am (I started <a href="http://www.beachbody.com/product/fitness_programs/insanity.do">Insanity</a> two weeks ago), then getting ready and off for my day. I hate rushed mornings and it  takes me about an hour and a half to eat, make lunch, and get ready, but I&#8217;m still in the process of optimizing and parallel-processing my mornings. I&#8217;m aiming to get it under an hour, then under 45 minutes so I can catch my bus and get to lab before&nbsp;8:15.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important to keep your exercise at the same time every day because your body gets used to when it gets physically taxed. It&#8217;s also been shown that people who exercise in the morning stick to daily workouts for&nbsp;longer.</p>
<h1>No. 3: Minimize your decisions about&nbsp;food</h1>
<p>Fortunately for me, I&#8217;m getting paid less than $30K a year as a graduate student so I can&#8217;t afford to go out for meals every day. So I don&#8217;t have to choose what to eat at lunch every day because it&#8217;s already been figured out for&nbsp;me.</p>
<p>I love cooking, but I despise cooking every day because I think it&#8217;s a waste of time. Last year at Univ. Calif. - Santa Cruz, I would make a large batch of a fried rice or pasta dish each week, and then take those leftovers to lunch with me. I&#8217;ve been doing the same thing here at <span class="caps">UC</span>-San Diego. Check out this picture from my&nbsp;fridge:</p>
<p><img alt="Olga's refrigerator" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-EuMSvyu7ySM/UGfFd_Ph8aI/AAAAAAAAI1Y/AyzZB7zNJm0/s1223/IMAG0056.jpg" /></p>
<p>Yes, my shelf of the fridge is quite stuffed. I went to <a href="http://www.costco.com/">Costco</a> today and got a bunch of food. I&#8217;ve annotated the photo, and here are some further&nbsp;details:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Breakfast:</strong>  I have an amazing <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Zojirushi-NS-LAC05XA-Uncooked-Cooker-Stainless/dp/B000G30ESY">rice cooker</a> that has a &#8220;porridge&#8221; setting and a timer. At night, I pour in my 1/4 cup oatmeal, 1/4 sweetened vanilla almond milk, tablespoon of coconut milk, splash of vanilla (I really like vanilla), some salt, and 1/2 cup water into the rice cooker and set the timer for 7am. When I&#8217;m done working out and showering, my food is ready! I also add in a banana, which I cut into the bowl with a spoon, and some walnuts. Very&nbsp;filling.</li>
<li><strong>Lunch:</strong> This week I made a very spicy and delicious ground beef fried rice that was a combination of these <a href="http://chinesefood.about.com/od/ricefried/r/Ground-Beef-Fried-Rice-Recipe.htm">two</a> <a href="http://www.food.com/recipe/kittencals-ground-beef-fried-rice-150499">recipes</a>. I marinated the beef in soy sauce, toasted sesame oil, chili oil, salt, black pepper, and white pepper, for about 15 or so minutes in the fridge. Then I fried that up in a dutch oven, though I should have fried the chopped onion first. Then added 2 square inches of grated ginger, a whole head of minced garlic, and a tablespoon each of red pepper flakes and cayenne powder. Then came the vegetables - about four cups of frozen Normandy Mix vegetables from Costco, a cup of frozen peas, and a can of baby corn. While the vegetables were cooking, I scrambled eight (8) eggs with salt, pepper, and toasted sesame oil, and added that to the mix. Then I added three cups of brown rice and mixed it all together. Turned out quite well! Then I packed the food into several glass tupperware&nbsp;containers.</li>
<li><strong>Post-lunch:</strong> I like having snacks around but I want them to be pre-portioned out for me. That&#8217;s probably why the 100-calorie packs have taken off so well. Costco has gigantic bags of baby carrots, sugar snap peas, and broccoli florets that I packed into individual snack packs. This is great because when I pack my lunch bag in the morning, I know that I just need to grab a tupperware and a veggie bag and I&#8217;m&nbsp;set.</li>
<li><strong>Dinner:</strong> I don&#8217;t like eating a lot at night because it makes me feel nauseous when I lie down if I&#8217;m full. Using <a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1933615486/">America&#8217;s Test Kitchen&#8217;s cookbook</a> (highly recommended, especially for less-experienced cooks because their explanations are fabulous) as a guideline, I make a salad for dinner just about every night. My favorite is the &#8220;Herb Salad&#8221; mix from Trader Joe&#8217;s, a handful of blueberries, 1/4 cup of freshly-toasted almonds (I just toast them in a dry skillet), several strips of parmesan shaved with a vegetable peeler, and some home made balsamic&nbsp;dressing.</li>
<li><strong>Dessert:</strong> It&#8217;s good to indulge. I adore the sweet/salty mix, so there&#8217;s some dark chocolate with carmel and sea salt not pictured in the freezer (so it doesn&#8217;t get too gooey). Other times I&#8217;ll have greek yogurt with honey and blueberries. But I don&#8217;t always feel like&nbsp;dessert.</li>
</ul>
