            <p>Last weekend I attended the <a href="http://codeneuro.org/2015/NYC/">CodeNeuro <span class="caps">NYC</span></a>
conference, which is a conference for neuroscientists, programmers, and
everything in between. It was a unique experience because it had both the
excitement and energy of a tech conference, and the pure, unadulterated zest
for knowledge of a scientific&nbsp;conference.</p>
<h2>Day 1: Talks and&nbsp;panel</h2>
<p>The first day of the conference started after the workday on Friday at 5pm at
the <a href="http://www.newmuseum.org/">New Museum</a> in Little Italy, Manhattan, <span class="caps">NYC</span>.
This was the first time I&#8217;d been to this place and it was really awesome, even
from the outside! Check it&nbsp;out:</p>
<p>[photo of&nbsp;outside]</p>
<p>The conference kicked off with some mingling and beer (Pabst Blue Ribbon aka
<span class="caps">PBR</span> to be specific &#8230; a little too bro-y/hipster-y for me personally so I
abstained. I <em>did</em> tell the organizers I would have appreciated some wine,
though&nbsp;:).</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PBR?src=hash">#<span class="caps">PBR</span></a> a plenty <a href="https://twitter.com/CodeNeuro">@CodeNeuro</a> and we&#39;re ready to start! <a href="http://t.co/QpJ3nIYk2J">pic.twitter.com/QpJ3nIYk2J</a></p>&mdash; paco nathan (@pacoid) <a href="https://twitter.com/pacoid/status/586649963133853697">April 10, 2015</a></blockquote>

<p>I only knew three people coming in to the conference, <a href="http://www.janelia.org/people/scientist/nick-sofroniew">Nick
Sofroniew</a>, with whom
I did an <a href="http://www.janelia.org/student-programs/undergraduate-program#722">undergrad summer program</a> and put me in touch with the conference in the
first place, <a href="http://www.jeremyfreeman.net/">Jeremy Freeman</a>, who organized
the whole freakin&#8217; thing and invited me to give a talk and tutorial, and <a href="https://twitter.com/bensussman">Ben
Sussman</a>, who co-taught the <code>gitgoing</code>
tutorial with me and is an all-around awesome person. But the space was rad,
we had a balcony and a nice view of the city, and I got to meet a bunch of
people doing super interesting things in&nbsp;neuroscience.</p>

<p>[photo collage/click through? of photos, mine plus curated from twitter from the&nbsp;event]</p>
<p>We got started with the talks, which we had three 10 minute (ish) talks, followed by a half hour (ish) break. It was a nice format that we could chat and break in between the talks not only to get a mental break but also discuss the concepts presented by the previous talks in the context of neuroscience. Here&#8217;s all the&nbsp;talks:</p>
<ol>
<li>Adam Packer (<span class="caps">UCL</span>)</li>
<li>Eiman Azim (Columbia): Using optogenetics to understand&nbsp;interneurons</li>
<li>Randal Burns (Johns Hopkins): Open Connectome project using <span class="caps">CATMAID</span> [<a href="https://github.com/openconnectome/ocpcatmaid">github repo</a>]</li>
<li>Paco Nathan (Databricks): Spark for big&nbsp;data</li>
<li>Eliza Chang (The Data&nbsp;Incubator): </li>
<li>Michael Dewar (<span class="caps">NYT</span>): Real-time analytics on streaming data [<a href="https://github.com/mikedewar/codeneuro_streamtools">github repo for presentation</a>] | [<a href="https://github.com/nytlabs/streamtools">github repo for <code>streamtools</code> package</a>] </li>
<li>Hilary Parker (Etsy): Data science at Etsy (+cute statistical&nbsp;plushies!)</li>
<li>Brendan Lake (<span class="caps">NYU</span>): Teaching computers to scribble characters like&nbsp;humans</li>
<li>Olga Botvinnik, me! (<span class="caps">UCSD</span>): <code>flotilla</code>: An open-source Python package for iterative machine learning analyses [<a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/format/slides/gist/olgabot/2ee1087d74df46c842df#/">slides</a>]</li>
</ol>
<p>My top three favorite talks&nbsp;were:</p>
<p><strong><span class="caps">NYT</span> R&amp;D demo</strong> This was a fantastic talk about streaming data analytics.  He
and his team had created an interactive way to analyze real-time data. They
had a <span class="caps">GUI</span> interface where you could select boxes that represented an action on
data (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load">extract, transform, load aka
<span class="caps">ETL</span></a>-like things), and
you could string these boxes together to create an analysis pipeline. It
reminded me a lot of the <a href="https://usegalaxy.org/">Galaxy</a> interface for
reproducible bioinformatics pipelines. Check out the tweet below for a&nbsp;screenshot:</p>

<p><strong>Optogenetics</strong>.</p>
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>A.

<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

<p><strong>Spark</strong>. This was an awesome talk by <a href="http://liber118.com/pxn/">Paco Nathan</a>
on using big data tools. Paco had worked with both Hadoop and Spark and gave a
great overview of the history of Big Data (which he pinpointed to Q3 1997),
the different papers about it and tools for it, and where Spark fits in that
ecosystem. He gave a few use cases and was overall just a very entertaining&nbsp;presenter.</p>

<p>[The most retweeted talks?? Maybe a Storify of the @CodeNeuro account for April 10th&nbsp;2015]</p>
<p>After all the talks, there was a panel led by Jeremy with some giants of
neuroscientists, Tony Movshon, Eve Marder and Larry Abbott. A recurring theme
was that the fundamental questions of how the brain works hasn&#8217;t changed, but
the tools have drastically&nbsp;changed.</p>
<p>One story that stuck with me was Eve describing that when she was doing
experiments, she used an
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscilloscope">oscilloscope</a> to listen (yes, with
her ears! I thought this was amazing!) to the measurements from neurons, and
there was a direct, phsyical, visceral reaction that when you designed an
experiment and heard specific tones, you knew <strong>exactly</strong> what that meant,
because you were intimately familiar with the exact tones and sounds produced
by the device. But now, she said, the high throughput methods, while capable
of measuring many things at once, are so detached from the physicality of
neurons firing that she feels people aren&#8217;t connected to what they&#8217;re
measuring anymore. I found that interesting because in my field of <span class="caps">RNA</span>
biology, we&#8217;ll do these newfangled <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing#Next-
generation_methods">high-throughput sequencing
experiments</a> to measure <span class="caps">RNA</span> expression as a proxy for protein
abundance, and study the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_splicing">alternative
splicing</a> of these <span class="caps">RNA</span>
transcripts, but every time, we always have to validate our findings using an
older, low-throughput method like <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revers
e_transcription_polymerase_chain_reaction"><span class="caps">RT</span>-<span class="caps">PCR</span></a>. I don&#8217;t know what the equivalent
experiments are in neuroscience, because it seems all very magical to me that
they&#8217;re able to manipulate individual neurons in mice, but I also wonder if
it&#8217;s known that the neuron in the exact same position in one animal and
another animal, do the exact same thing. So far, biology has relied on laws of
averages, so if you do a high throughput experiment on a bunch of cells and
get an average signal, you should get that same result if you do a low-
throughput version of that experiment. I don&#8217;t know what the equivalent of
that is in neuroscience, but it was refreshing to hear that neuro has its own
share of growing pains as its adopted its own high-throughput techniques, and
that biology wasn&#8217;t the only&nbsp;one.</p>
<p>It was interesting to hear about the challenges of neuroscience, of how
excited people are about optogenetics, and how many people are apparently
skeptical of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging">functional magentic resonance
imaging</a>
(fMRI) data, and how nobody knows what the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex">cerebral
cortex</a>&nbsp;does!</p>
<h2>Day 2: Tutorials +&nbsp;Hackathon</h2>
<p>The next morning we were in the <a href="http://www.newinc.org/">New, Inc</a> coworking
space, and started off with some kickass bagels and&nbsp;lox/salmon:</p>
