            <p>Recently I subscribed to <a href="http://jamesclear.com/">James Clear</a>&#8216;s blog and his writing and advice has resonated with me. The last time I felt like someone was speaking directly through me was Cal Newport&#8217;s <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/">Study Hacks</a> blog, which I discovered during undergrad, and I felt it directly addressed the issues I was having with keeping up with my intense&nbsp;courseload.</p>
<p>James Clear posted his <a href="http://jamesclear.com/2014-annual-review">2014 Annual Review</a> in December, and it reminded me of how we do annual self-evaluations for work. I read through my evaluation for 2013 and enjoyed reflecting back on that time, how much I did then, what didn&#8217;t go well, and what I&#8217;ve learned since. So I&#8217;m going to follow his template with the following three&nbsp;questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>What went well this&nbsp;year?</li>
<li>What didn’t go so well this&nbsp;year?</li>
<li>What am I working&nbsp;toward?</li>
</ol>
<h2>1. What went well this&nbsp;year?</h2>
<p><strong>Fellowships.</strong> This year, I was the first and sole recipient of the <a href="http://numfocus.org/news/2014/07/01/john-hunter-technology-fellowship-awarded/">NumFOCUS John Hunter Technology Fellowship</a>. I was thrilled to receive it, especially because I thought I had no chance of getting it. From the wording of the announcement, which said &#8220;postdoctoral scientists or senior graduate students,&#8221; I thought I wasn&#8217;t seasoned enough, and I figured people who work on <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/"><code>scikit-learn</code></a> and <a href="http://ipython.org/">IPython</a> would apply and definitely get it over me. Plus I couldn&#8217;t think of anyone who would be willing to be my Software Mentor, as required for the application. Thankfully, at <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2014/">PyCon</a>, I was talking to <a href="https://twitter.com/ctitusbrown">Titus Brown</a> and mentioned that I wanted to apply to this fellowship but thought I wouldn&#8217;t get it, and that didn&#8217;t have a Software Mentor. Immediately, he dismissed my doubts and offered be my Software Mentor, on the spot! I almost cried because I was so happy and surprised to hear someone believe in me so strongly, especially because at the time I was getting major shade and negativity from certain peers back&nbsp;home.</p>
<p><strong>Python involvement.</strong> I&#8217;m very proud to have contributed to the <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/index.html"><code>seaborn</code></a> statistical data visualization Python package, specifically creating the first-ever (that I know of) single-line clustered heatmap function in Python! It was months of work, and couldn&#8217;t have been done without the input from <a href="https://twitter.com/mike_t_lovci">Mike Lovci</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cdeboever3">Christopher DeBoever</a>. Plus now I have more clout to evangelize Python for bioinformatics research&nbsp;:)</p>
<p><strong>Passed Qualifying Exam!</strong> On May 15th, 2014, I proved my competency to a group of three professors, who all agreed that I can move on to the next stage of graduate school! I spent a solid month writing and working on my presentation and was <strong>very</strong> nervous and stressed about it, so it was very satisfying to be&nbsp;over.</p>
<p><strong>Travel and conferences</strong> Last year I traveled to:
<em> Strata 2014 in Santa Clara, California
</em> PyCon 2014 in Montreal, Canada
<em> Post-quals vacation in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico
</em> Single-cell genomics conference in Stockholm, Sweden. Plus Italy (Rome and Venice) afterwards
* PyData 2014 (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQksDvFl2_8">gave a talk!</a>)</p>
<p><strong>Photography</strong></p>
<p><strong>Personal relationships.</strong> I had some tough interpersonal issues this year and in talking through it with a friend, they recommended the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Difficult-Conversations-Discuss-What-Matters/dp/0143118447">Difficult Conversations</a>. I highly recommend this book to everyone, because difficult conversations happen every day, and this will provide you the tools and perspectives you need to understand them. I can honestly say that the book has changed my life and helped me critically evaluate everyone&#8217;s role in a tricky spot, and come up with strategies in how to approach these situations tactfully. Tact has never been my strong suit, so these lessons were&nbsp;eye-opening.</p>
<h2>2. What didn&#8217;t go so well this&nbsp;year?</h2>
<p><strong>Not being afraid of the unknown.</strong> These first few years of graduate school, if some task took steps that I couldn&#8217;t clearly visualize, or I could see them but I thought they were too hard, I wouldn&#8217;t do it, and my research would suffer as a result. For example, I&#8217;ve been putting off doing a complicated operation on a bunch of sequences that would help my research in ways I can&#8217;t comprehend now, but it was so nebulous to me that I didn&#8217;t even want to attempt&nbsp;it.</p>
<p><strong>Blogging.</strong> I published 10 total blog posts in 2014. I switched to hosting my blog using github.io rather than Tumblr in 2014. I thought my lack of blogging was a result of my blog being on Tumblr and being ugly and annoying to write IPython notebook style blog posts for it, rather than using markdown/IPython entries. I <em>did</em> have 6 blog posts after September, compared to 4 pre-September, so the change helped. But I still feel I could have blogged more, even small random things I found helpful like that bit about using <a href="http://blog.olgabotvinnik.com/different-branches-different-ipython-notebooks-.html">different git branches in different IPython notebooks</a>, which was a great discovery for me in my development workflow. I think part of my lack of posts was also the misguided belief that every post has to be a gigantic, perfectly crafted tome, when it&#8217;s fine to have a concise 100-word&nbsp;post.</p>
<p><strong>Publishing.</strong> I didn&#8217;t complete any scientific publications this year. While it&#8217;s not common for a 2nd-year graduate student to publish a paper, I thought I was working hard towards that goal, but in reality, I didn&#8217;t understand the magnitude of work that goes into a publication. I also think my <em>being afraid of the unknown</em>, not knowing how to do something and being afraid of being wrong, also played into&nbsp;this.</p>
<p><strong>Regular progress&nbsp;reviews.</strong> </p>
<p><strong>Python involvement.</strong> You may wonder why this topic is in both the &#8220;went well&#8221; and &#8220;didn&#8217;t go so well&#8221; categories. While I&#8217;m happy with my <code>seaborn</code> contributions, I haven&#8217;t been as happy with other things. There&#8217;s been features I&#8217;ve wanted to add to <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/"><code>pandas</code></a> (read gzipped files over the internet) and other visualization features to <code>seaborn</code>, I haven&#8217;t gotten around to doing them. I did start subscribing to <code>matplotlib-devel</code> and watching the <code>seaborn</code> repo for all issues, and replied to a few, but I&#8217;m still afraid that I don&#8217;t have anything to add to the&nbsp;conversation.</p>
<p><strong>Sustaining interest.</strong> As both <a href="http://jamesclear.com/stay-focused">James Clear</a> and <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2009/06/22/on-the-value-of-hard-focus/">Cal Newport</a> have discussed, it&#8217;s consistent, sustained effort and focus over a long period of time which generates results. I find it really easy to start something fresh and new, and I struggle with maintaining interest in something long enough to reap the rewards at the&nbsp;end.</p>
<p><strong>Cello</strong> Last January I performed a small cello concert for my friends, and worked really hard practicing a lot for it. But this last six months I haven&#8217;t practiced much. Part of it is my teacher had personal commitments that prevented him from teaching for some time, but I think the more major part is that I didn&#8217;t pay for my lessons. I was supposed to help him with his <a href="http://www.celloloftmusic.com/cellosophy/">Cellosophy</a> cello app, but honestly I just bit off more than I could chew. The coding was going to be for the instructor website in <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> and that&#8217;s not part of my core competency, so it was a lot of work for me to just make a bar chart. And so I didn&#8217;t do a good job of collaborating&#8230; and as a result I didn&#8217;t ascribe as much value as I should have to my lessons, and didn&#8217;t invest as much time in them. Once I get back into cello, I&#8217;m going to pay for them. As expensive as they are, they are worth&nbsp;it.</p>
<p><strong>Fitness</strong> I was very good about going to yoga and exercising 4+ times a week, but something happened around August and I stopped working out as much. I gained some weight and lost fitness, and I&#8217;m now trying to change that (see next&nbsp;section)</p>
