            <p>Recently I subscribed to <a href="http://jamesclear.com/">James Clear</a>&#8216;s blog and his writing and advice has resonated with me. The last time I felt like someone was speaking directly through me was Cal Newport&#8217;s <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/">Study Hacks</a> blog, which I discovered during undergrad, and I felt it directly addressed the issues I was having with keeping up with my intense&nbsp;courseload. </p>
<p>James Clear posted his <a href="http://jamesclear.com/2014-annual-review">2014 Annual Review</a> in December, and it reminded me of how we do annual self-evaluations for work. I read through my evaluation for 2013 and enjoyed reflecting back on that time, how much I did then, what didn&#8217;t go well, and what I&#8217;ve learned since. So I&#8217;m going to follow his template with the following three&nbsp;questions.</p>
<ol>
<li>What went well this&nbsp;year?</li>
<li>What didn’t go so well this&nbsp;year?</li>
<li>What am I working&nbsp;toward?</li>
</ol>
<h2>1. What went well this&nbsp;year?</h2>
<p><strong>Fellowships.</strong> This year, I was the first and sole recipient of the <a href="http://numfocus.org/news/2014/07/01/john-hunter-technology-fellowship-awarded/">NumFOCUS John Hunter Technology Fellowship</a>. I was thrilled to receive it, especially because I thought I had no chance of getting it. From the wording of the announcement, which said &#8220;postdoctoral scientists or senior graduate students,&#8221; I thought I wasn&#8217;t seasoned enough, and I figured people who work on <a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/"><code>scikit-learn</code></a> and <a href="http://ipython.org/">IPython</a> would apply and definitely get it over me. Plus I couldn&#8217;t think of anyone who would be willing to be my Software Mentor, as required for the application. Thankfully, at <a href="https://us.pycon.org/2014/">PyCon</a>, I was talking to <a href="https://twitter.com/ctitusbrown">Titus Brown</a> and mentioned that I wanted to apply to this fellowship but thought I wouldn&#8217;t get it, and that didn&#8217;t have a Software Mentor. Immediately, he dismissed my doubts and offered be my Software Mentor, on the spot! I almost cried because I was so happy and surprised to hear someone believe in me so strongly, especially because for the previous year I had been getting major shade and negativity from certain peers back home, which majorly impacted my mental state and made me feel constantly&nbsp;inadequate.</p>
<p><strong>Python involvement.</strong> I&#8217;m very proud to have contributed to the <a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/index.html"><code>seaborn</code></a> statistical data visualization Python package, specifically creating the first-ever (that I know of) single-line clustered heatmap function in Python! It was months of work, and couldn&#8217;t have been done without the input from <a href="https://twitter.com/mike_t_lovci">Mike Lovci</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/cdeboever3">Christopher DeBoever</a>. Plus now I have more clout to evangelize Python for bioinformatics research&nbsp;:)</p>
<p><strong>Passed Qualifying Exam!</strong> On May 15th, 2014, I proved my competency to a group of three professors, who all agreed that I can move on to the next stage of graduate school! I spent a solid month writing and working on my presentation and was <strong>very</strong> nervous and stressed about it, so it was very satisfying to be&nbsp;over.</p>
<p><strong>Travel and conferences</strong> Last year I traveled&nbsp;to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Strata 2014 in Santa Clara,&nbsp;California</li>
<li>PyCon 2014 in Montreal,&nbsp;Canada</li>
<li>Post-quals vacation in Cabo San Lucas,&nbsp;Mexico</li>
<li>Single-cell genomics conference in Stockholm, Sweden. Plus Italy (Rome and Venice)&nbsp;afterwards</li>
<li>PyData 2014 (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQksDvFl2_8">gave a talk!</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>It&#8217;s been a great experience to visit these places and make new friends in the Python, data science, and single-cell communities. Looking forward to more this&nbsp;year!</p>
<p><strong>Photography</strong> While I haven&#8217;t publicly shared much photography, I&#8217;ve taken lots of photos on these different trips. The Europe trip was especially good, because I purposely tested out different settings in low light and other tough situations, and I spent a <span class="caps">LOT</span> of time watching LightRoom tutorials on editing, and learned a lot of new techniques that I&#8217;ve been practicing with new&nbsp;photos.</p>
<p><strong>Personal relationships.</strong> I had some tough interpersonal issues this year and in talking through it with a friend, they recommended the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Difficult-Conversations-Discuss-What-Matters/dp/0143118447">Difficult Conversations</a>. I highly recommend this book to everyone, because difficult conversations happen every day, and this will provide you the tools and perspectives you need to understand them. I can honestly say that the book has changed my life and helped me critically evaluate everyone&#8217;s role in a tricky spot, and come up with strategies in how to approach these situations tactfully. Tact has never been my strong suit, so these lessons were&nbsp;eye-opening.</p>
<h2>2. What didn&#8217;t go so well this&nbsp;year?</h2>
<p><strong>Not being afraid of the unknown or difficult.</strong> These first few years of graduate school, if some task took steps that I couldn&#8217;t clearly visualize, or I could see them but I thought they were too hard, I wouldn&#8217;t do it, and my research would suffer as a result. For example, I&#8217;ve been putting off doing a complicated operation on a bunch of sequences that would help my research in ways I can&#8217;t comprehend now, but it was so nebulous to me that I didn&#8217;t even want to attempt it. Or I&#8217;d get some result and not know how to interpret it, and the solution was to go to the literature and read a bunch of papers about those genes, but that&#8217;s too hard so I didn&#8217;t want to do&nbsp;it.</p>
<p><strong>Blogging.</strong> I published 10 total blog posts in 2014. I switched to hosting my blog using github.io rather than Tumblr in 2014. I thought my lack of blogging was a result of my blog being on Tumblr and being ugly and annoying to write IPython notebook style blog posts for it, rather than using markdown/IPython entries. I <em>did</em> have 6 blog posts after September, compared to 4 pre-September, so the change helped. But I still feel I could have blogged more, even small random things I found helpful like that bit about using <a href="http://blog.olgabotvinnik.com/different-branches-different-ipython-notebooks-.html">different git branches in different IPython notebooks</a>, which was a great discovery for me in my development workflow. I think part of my lack of posts was also the misguided belief that every post has to be a gigantic, perfectly crafted tome, when it&#8217;s fine to have a concise 100-word&nbsp;post.</p>
<p><strong>Publishing.</strong> I didn&#8217;t complete any scientific publications this year. While it&#8217;s not common for a 2nd-year graduate student to publish a paper, I thought I was working hard towards that goal, but in reality, I didn&#8217;t understand the magnitude of work that goes into a publication. I also think my <em>being afraid of the unknown</em>, not knowing how to do something and being afraid of being wrong, also played into&nbsp;this.</p>
<p><strong>Regular progress reviews.</strong> Every once in a while I put together weekly progress reviews of what I did that week and what&#8217;s the plan for the next week. It makes me feel good, and it works for a bit, but then I give it up because I think &#8220;ehh, I&#8217;ll just remember what I need to do.&#8221; I feel I spend too much time on trivial things like reformatting code or making some plot look just slightly better (but not necessarily more readable), rather than moving on to the next&nbsp;thing.</p>
<p><strong>Python involvement.</strong> You may wonder why this topic is in both the &#8220;went well&#8221; and &#8220;didn&#8217;t go so well&#8221; categories. While I&#8217;m happy with my <code>seaborn</code> contributions, I haven&#8217;t been as happy with other things. There&#8217;s been features I&#8217;ve wanted to add to <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/"><code>pandas</code></a> (read gzipped files over the internet) and other visualization features to <code>seaborn</code>, I haven&#8217;t gotten around to doing them. I did start subscribing to <code>matplotlib-devel</code> and watching the <code>seaborn</code> repo for all issues, and replied to a few, but I&#8217;m still afraid that I don&#8217;t have anything to add to the&nbsp;conversation.</p>
<p><strong>Sustaining interest.</strong> As both <a href="http://jamesclear.com/stay-focused">James Clear</a> and <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2009/06/22/on-the-value-of-hard-focus/">Cal Newport</a> have discussed, it&#8217;s consistent, sustained effort and focus over a long period of time which generates results. I find it really easy to start something fresh and new, and I struggle with maintaining interest in something long enough to reap the rewards at the&nbsp;end.</p>
<p><strong>Cello</strong> Last January I performed a small cello concert for my friends, and worked really hard practicing a lot for it. But this last six months I haven&#8217;t practiced much. Part of it is my teacher had personal commitments that prevented him from teaching for some time, but I think the more major part is that I didn&#8217;t pay for my lessons. I was supposed to help him with his <a href="http://www.celloloftmusic.com/cellosophy/">Cellosophy</a> cello app, but honestly I just bit off more than I could chew. The coding was going to be for the instructor website in <a href="http://d3js.org/">D3.js</a> and that&#8217;s not part of my core competency, so it was a lot of work for me to just make a bar chart. And so I didn&#8217;t do a good job of collaborating&#8230; and as a result I didn&#8217;t ascribe as much value as I should have to my lessons, and didn&#8217;t invest as much time in them. Once I get back into cello, I&#8217;m going to pay for them. As expensive as they are, they are worth&nbsp;it.</p>
<p><strong>Fitness</strong> I was very good about going to yoga and exercising 4+ times a week, but something happened around August and I stopped working out as much. I gained some weight and lost fitness, and I&#8217;m now trying to change that (see next&nbsp;section).</p>
<h2>3. What am I working&nbsp;toward?</h2>
<p><strong>Regular progress reviews + Time-boxing.</strong> I&#8217;ve started <a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2013/12/21/deep-habits-the-importance-of-planning-every-minute-of-your-work-day/">planning my workday</a> carefully in a <a href="http://amzn.com/8867322729?tag=sciencmeetpro-20">Moleskine daily planner</a> (in green, my favorite color). This is part of what my colleague <a href="https://twitter.com/leenyann">Colleen Stoyas</a> likes to call <a href="https://twitter.com/LeenyAnn/status/563335731070771200">#projectGETONYOGAME</a>. Writing down how I spend my hours has been a very effective way for me to keep track of where the time goes, especially when it turns out that what I thought was a 30 minute break turned into an hour and a half of eating and chatting&#8230; yikes. I&#8217;m taking the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1585425524/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;camp=1789&amp;creative=390957&amp;creativeASIN=1585425524&amp;linkCode=as2&amp;tag=sciencmeetpro-20&amp;linkId=PJBK7XP4R2HJIX6N">Now Habit</a> approach of not trying to change my habits dramatically, but writing everything down and paying attention to what I&#8217;m doing. Below are some example schedules I&#8217;ve created, for days that went as planned, and others that did not. The images have been blurred for&nbsp;privacy.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s a sample day that went quite well, and I mostly stuck to my schedule. You&#8217;ll notice I have some random notes on the side of reminders of people to meet with, and I even drew out a network. However, I <em>did</em> end up taking a 1.5 hour break from lingering around and chatting, which I probably could have shortened and ended my day&nbsp;earlier.</p>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/3FbYHIa"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/3FbYHIa.jpg" alt="Example hour plan for a day that went mostly as planned" style="width: 200px;"/></a></p>
<p>Below is an example day that didn&#8217;t go as planned, where I started late and thus deviated from the schedule quite a bit. I also got the time wrong for when I was supposed to be teaching data cleaning (2pm not 12pm), so that changed things up too. While this didn&#8217;t go completely as planned, I was able to squeeze a lot of work&nbsp;in.</p>
<p><a href="http://imgur.com/iNcLFjg"><img src="http://i.imgur.com/iNcLFjg.jpg" alt="Example hour plan for a day that didn't go as planned" style="width: 200px;"/></a></p>
<p><strong>Publishing.</strong> It&#8217;s hard for me to call a project &#8220;done enough,&#8221; and yet this is exactly what I need to do to be able to publish. I have a couple conference abstract and presentation deadlines coming up in the next few months which will help me to focus on creating &#8220;publishable units.&#8221; Plus I have my advancement in a month, so that will be a big push to get manuscripts ready so I can say that certain projects are at least &#8220;submitted&#8221; to my&nbsp;committee.</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://grad.ucsd.edu/progress/candidacy.html">Advancing to candidacy</a>.</strong> In our program, the &#8220;Advancement Exam&#8221; or &#8220;Senate Exam&#8221; is when you show your committee what research you&#8217;ve accomplished so far, and your plan for your PhD. I&#8217;m very nervous for it, and have been doing a lot of background reading to be able to motivate why my projects are important, and why they make sense to be done together. I&#8217;m planning to do this in March, so wish me&nbsp;luck!</p>
<p><strong>Fitness.</strong> I signed up for my first half-marathon, the <a href="http://www.lajollahalfmarathon.com/">La Jolla Half Marathon</a>! I&#8217;ve been training hard for it, maybe a little too hard because I hurt my knee and am resting it now (no running for 1&nbsp;week!).</p>
<p><strong>Photography.</strong> I have a bunch of photos I&#8217;ve taken of nature, flowers, architecture, scenery, and LegoLand that I use as backgrounds, and I&#8217;m planning on sharing them as an album. As motivation, I&#8217;m also planning to apply to this year&#8217;s <a href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2014/09/ubuntu-14-10-wallpaper-contest-winners">Ubuntu Wallpaper Contest</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Cello.</strong> I&#8217;m going to start scheduling time to play cello, even if its only fifteen minutes, it&#8217;s still an important&nbsp;investment.</p>
