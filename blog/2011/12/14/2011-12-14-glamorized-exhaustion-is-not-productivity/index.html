I&#8217;ve been working on this project for 12 hours&nbsp;nonstop.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>  <p class="p1">But this attitude and work style just isn&#8217;t effective. I&#8217;m determined to change how I work to be more effective and more&nbsp;productive.</p>  <p class="p1">This realization has not come easily.&nbsp;I used to live and breathe exhaustion. In high school, I had days where I had school 7:45am-3:15pm, then crew (rowing - I was a coxswain) practice 4pm-7pm, then orchestra rehearsal until 9pm. Then homework! In undergrad, I double majored in addition to my many activities, and I was constantly&nbsp;tired.</p>  <p class="p1">Last year, something changed. I worked at a research institution, focused on the tasks and projects I needed to accomplish, and worked consistently to achieve these goals. I exercised almost daily. I cooked almost all my meals. And I was the most productive I have ever&nbsp;been.</p>  <p class="p1">If a job is easy, what makes the student life so difficult? When you&#8217;re done with your job, you&#8217;re done. Working at home is not necessary, any work you do is bonus points. But as a student, the structure doesn&#8217;t exist. You have classes and deadlines. Go. But to succeed and be happy while you do it, you must create your own&nbsp;schedule.</p>  <p class="p1">University students everywhere cram for their exams, then feel miserable and perform poorly. The problem derives not from mental ability, but a lack of consistent time scheduling to activities. At <span class="caps">MIT</span>, a typical course is 12 &#8220;units,&#8221; where a &#8220;unit&#8221; is an hour of work expected per week. An introductory biology course divides its units to 5 in lecture, 0 in lab, and 7 studying at home, or 5-0-7. Why didn&#8217;t I harness this knowledge to plan my week and execute homework with efficient precision? A number of excuses come to mind, I was lazy, I didn&#8217;t feel like starting problem sets so early, but the biggest reason was <strong>that&#8217;s what I always did</strong>.</p>  <p class="p1">I could get away with these study habits in high school and do well, but college was a whole different ballgame. Even so, if you walk into the reading room/library before 5pm, you&#8217;ll see nary a soul. But from 7pm on, the desks are packed with people studying at a time where their brain is far too tired. They end up sleeping in the reading room. During the day, these students fill the hallways, glamorizing their exhaustion and out-suffering their friends. It&#8217;s&nbsp;pitiful.</p>  <p class="p1">I&#8217;m determined to change the way students approach work. Instead of bingeing and writing a paper in a 14-hour marathon, mindfully gather your ideas and craft a well-thought essay. Rather than waiting until the last minute to start your programming assignment, prime your mind early on by thinking through the pseudocode and produce a nicely commented&nbsp;program.</p>  <p class="p1">In my last year of undergrad, I used these strategies increased both my <span class="caps">GPA</span> and my relaxation time. Starting early really&nbsp;works!</p>  <p class="p1">Next time, I&#8217;ll discuss the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Advice-Faculty-Members-Robert-Boice/dp/0205281591">Advice for New Faculty Members</a> and why it applies to you, regardless of whether you are in academia or&nbsp;not.</p></div>
