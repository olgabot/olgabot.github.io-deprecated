But in academia, the currency is not published units but citations of your publications. For someone to not only read your paper but understand and cite it, you need to produce high-quality, readable papers. And that requires deep&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deep&amp;nbsp;Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m an avid reader of &lt;a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/"&gt;Cal Newport&amp;#8217;s blog&lt;/a&gt; where he writes about managing your attention and energy to output high-quality work. I strongly believe that a person&amp;#8217;s work output is directly dependent on the hours they spend in deep work. &amp;#8220;Deep work&amp;#8221; is when you are fully &amp;#8220;in the zone&amp;#8221; - you have notifications turned off on your phone, you aren&amp;#8217;t checking your email or social media, and you are fully engaged in your complex activity. For me those activities could be writing or editing a paper, adding new features to my code, carefully curating a well-designed test dataset, tweaking an explanatory figure to make it more clear, working on an upcoming presentation with a new audience, or doing a new analysis of the&amp;nbsp;data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help keep track of your deep work, Cal Newport suggests &lt;a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2013/12/21/deep-habits-the-importance-of-planning-every-minute-of-your-work-day/"&gt;planning every minute of your day&lt;/a&gt;. It may sound crazy and obsessive-compulsive, but it really works. What he does is plan his day out on paper and adjust the schedule as things happen. I don&amp;#8217;t like that because then my day looks really messy and I want my &amp;#8220;on-paper&amp;#8221; plan to be an exact record of what actually happened. Instead, I plan my day out on &lt;a href="https://calendar.google.com"&gt;Google Calendar&lt;/a&gt; the day before (during the &amp;#8220;shutdown&amp;#8221; time) and record what actually happened in a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Moleskine-Daily-Planner-Large-Black/dp/B015NG44KC/ref=dp_ob_title_bk"&gt;Moleskine daily planner&lt;/a&gt; notebook (I love well made stationary products). Japanese pens are my favorite so I use the &lt;a href="http://www.jetpens.com/Uni-ball-Signo-UM-151-Gel-Pens/ct/286"&gt;Uni-ball Signo &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UM&lt;/span&gt;-151&lt;/a&gt; pens from &lt;a href="http://www.jetpens.com/blog/uni-ball-signo-a-comprehensive-guide/pt/639"&gt;JetPens&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8212; my preferred color is &amp;#8220;Green Black.&amp;#8221; Additionally, I keep a &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt; private GitHub repository containing markdown files for every week, and summarize what I was able to do that&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My days,&amp;nbsp;step-by-step&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s the step-by-step of my planning rituals, with pointers to the columns of the figure&amp;nbsp;below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Planning vs actual outcomes" src="/images/plan_vs_actual-300ppi.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the beginning of the week, I create a new markdown file and start filling it in with notes from last week and plans for this week. Sometimes my notes start with a big ole rant about some problem I&amp;#8217;ve been running into, or have a big rolling todo list that I keep updated for the week. &lt;strong&gt;The most important thing about each week&amp;#8217;s file is that each day is separate.&lt;/strong&gt; This way, you can keep track of the incremental progress you made that day, and what you hope to accomplish that day. (First column - files for each&amp;nbsp;week)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before each day starts, e.g. during &amp;#8220;shutdown&amp;#8221; time the day before (or sometimes on Fridays for the next Monday), I plan out what I want to do on Google Calendar. (Second column - plan for each day)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I find this works quite well because at the beginning of the day, I&amp;#8217;m bursting with energy and want to do &lt;em&gt;all of the things!&lt;/em&gt; But by the end of the day I&amp;#8217;ve realized that I can only do so much, and I&amp;#8217;m much better at prioritizing what&amp;#8217;s important, while at the beginning of the day I&amp;#8217;m much better at &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; things. So planning at the end of the day works for&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I make sure to schedule 30m for &amp;#8220;shutdown&amp;#8221; at the end of the day. If I don&amp;#8217;t do this, the system breaks because I stop planning, and I am at the mercy of my morning impulses, rather than being in control of what I&amp;#8217;m trying to&amp;nbsp;do.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Throughout the day, I &amp;#8220;stopwatch&amp;#8221; my time by writing down in my planner the exact minute that I start and stop each activity. (Third column)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I get interrupted, I end the time and start&amp;nbsp;again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If something comes to mind about an urgent task (e.g. submit travel insurance form), I write it down in my planner or a sticky note so I&amp;#8217;ve captured it, but continue on with my deep work. I do not interrupt my deep&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the end of the day, during &amp;#8220;shutdown,&amp;#8221; I briefly write down what I was able to do in my markdown document and what I hope to do tomorrow (Fourth&amp;nbsp;column).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally I write down the hours and minutes of deep work into the monthly part of the planner.&amp;nbsp;(below)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s where I write the hours and minutes I spent in deep work each day. I find that it helps keep me motivated to sustain the work and get more hours in the next&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Monthly tally" src="/images/deep_work_monthly_tally.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I&amp;#8217;ve found that ~4 hours of deep work is about when I max out, because if I do 5 hours one day, next day I end up doing 2 hours. But 4 hours a day is sustainable. As you can see, December hasn&amp;#8217;t been that productive of a month for me - only about 2-3 hours of deep work a day. The 40m day was one where I was traveling and just didn&amp;#8217;t set aside a time to fully focus and was at the mercy of my&amp;nbsp;impulses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you first start doing it, you may get frustrated that you&amp;#8217;re not getting much done &amp;#8212; that&amp;#8217;s okay. I get disappointed in myself when I don&amp;#8217;t  Don&amp;#8217;t get frustrated, just keep tracking. Just like any other goal such as losing weight, results don&amp;#8217;t come right&amp;nbsp;away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t overdo&amp;nbsp;it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I work in an &amp;#8220;open office&amp;#8221; environment which makes doing deep work quite difficult as there is constant movement and potential for interruptions around me. Our lab is quite collaborative so there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; times when your input or insight is needed for someone&amp;#8217;s project to go through. I made the mistake of taking this to an extreme and getting very frustrated when people would interrupt me while I was &amp;#8220;in the zone&amp;#8221; and tried to set boundaries but this closed me off from others. As Richard Hamming says in his fabulous talk, &lt;a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html"&gt;You and Your Research&lt;/a&gt; about people who closed themselves&amp;nbsp;off:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I noticed the following facts about people who work with the door open or the door closed. I notice that if you have the door to your office closed, you get more work done today and tomorrow, and you are more productive than most. But 10 years later somehow you don&amp;#8217;t know quite know what problems are worth working on; all the hard work you do is sort of tangential in importance. He who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but he also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important. Now I cannot prove the cause and effect sequence because you might say, &amp;#8220;The closed door is symbolic of a closed mind.&amp;#8221; I don&amp;#8217;t know. But I can say there is a pretty good correlation between those who work with the doors open and those who ultimately do important things, although people who work with doors closed often work harder. Somehow they seem to work on slightly the wrong thing - not much, but enough that they miss&amp;nbsp;fame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I had to learn to temper this desire to get solid work done and strike a balance between being available and performing intense work. Now, I take lunch off to socialize and chat with the group (rather than working through it), take my headphones off when I am available to work, and when I really need to get work done, I run away and go hide in a place that nobody can find&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Take what works for&amp;nbsp;you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Productivity is very personal and what works for me may not work for you. I am not trying to say that this is the OneTrueWay(&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TM&lt;/span&gt;) of being productive. This system exploits my love of &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; version control and simple Markdown text files (the &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt; private github repo), beautiful writing on good paper with nice pens (hence the Moleskine planner and Japanese pens), and flexibility of Google Calendar. My system may seem overwhelming at first because it is the product of many years of trying different things. For me, online tools like Asana and Trello make planning &amp;#8220;too fun&amp;#8221; and get in the way of what I want to do. Writing &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; out on paper makes for an ugly planner with lots of crossing out which I don&amp;#8217;t like. Take the ideas that work for you and leave the ones that don&amp;#8217;t.

So I&amp;#8217;m going to follow his template with the following three&amp;nbsp;questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What went well this&amp;nbsp;year?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What didn’t go so well this&amp;nbsp;year?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What am I working&amp;nbsp;toward?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. What went well this&amp;nbsp;year?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fellowships.&lt;/strong&gt; This year, I was the first and sole recipient of the &lt;a href="http://numfocus.org/news/2014/07/01/john-hunter-technology-fellowship-awarded/"&gt;NumFOCUS John Hunter Technology Fellowship&lt;/a&gt;. I was thrilled to receive it, especially because I thought I had no chance of getting it. From the wording of the announcement, which said &amp;#8220;postdoctoral scientists or senior graduate students,&amp;#8221; I thought I wasn&amp;#8217;t seasoned enough, and I figured people who work on &lt;a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;scikit-learn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://ipython.org/"&gt;IPython&lt;/a&gt; would apply and definitely get it over me. Plus I couldn&amp;#8217;t think of anyone who would be willing to be my Software Mentor, as required for the application. Thankfully, at &lt;a href="https://us.pycon.org/2014/"&gt;PyCon&lt;/a&gt;, I was talking to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ctitusbrown"&gt;Titus Brown&lt;/a&gt; and mentioned that I wanted to apply to this fellowship but thought I wouldn&amp;#8217;t get it, and that didn&amp;#8217;t have a Software Mentor. Immediately, he dismissed my doubts and offered be my Software Mentor, on the spot! I almost cried because I was so happy and surprised to hear someone believe in me so strongly, especially because for the previous year I had been getting major shade and negativity from certain peers back home, which majorly impacted my mental state and made me feel constantly&amp;nbsp;inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Python involvement.&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#8217;m very proud to have contributed to the &lt;a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/index.html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;seaborn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; statistical data visualization Python package, specifically creating the first-ever (that I know of) single-line clustered heatmap function in Python! It was months of work, and couldn&amp;#8217;t have been done without the input from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mike_t_lovci"&gt;Mike Lovci&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cdeboever3"&gt;Christopher DeBoever&lt;/a&gt;. Plus now I have more clout to evangelize Python for bioinformatics research&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passed Qualifying Exam!&lt;/strong&gt; On May 15th, 2014, I proved my competency to a group of three professors, who all agreed that I can move on to the next stage of graduate school! I spent a solid month writing and working on my presentation and was &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; nervous and stressed about it, so it was very satisfying to be&amp;nbsp;over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Travel and conferences&lt;/strong&gt; Last year I traveled&amp;nbsp;to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strata 2014 in Santa Clara,&amp;nbsp;California&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PyCon 2014 in Montreal,&amp;nbsp;Canada&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post-quals vacation in Cabo San Lucas,&amp;nbsp;Mexico&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Single-cell genomics conference in Stockholm, Sweden. Plus Italy (Rome and Venice)&amp;nbsp;afterwards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PyData 2014 (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQksDvFl2_8"&gt;gave a talk!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been a great experience to visit these places and make new friends in the Python, data science, and single-cell communities. Looking forward to more this&amp;nbsp;year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photography&lt;/strong&gt; While I haven&amp;#8217;t publicly shared much photography, I&amp;#8217;ve taken lots of photos on these different trips. The Europe trip was especially good, because I purposely tested out different settings in low light and other tough situations, and I spent a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LOT&lt;/span&gt; of time watching LightRoom tutorials on editing, and learned a lot of new techniques that I&amp;#8217;ve been practicing with new&amp;nbsp;photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal relationships.&lt;/strong&gt; I had some tough interpersonal issues this year and in talking through it with a friend, they recommended the book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Difficult-Conversations-Discuss-What-Matters/dp/0143118447"&gt;Difficult Conversations&lt;/a&gt;. I highly recommend this book to everyone, because difficult conversations happen every day, and this will provide you the tools and perspectives you need to understand them. I can honestly say that the book has changed my life and helped me critically evaluate everyone&amp;#8217;s role in a tricky spot, and come up with strategies in how to approach these situations tactfully. Tact has never been my strong suit, so these lessons were&amp;nbsp;eye-opening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. What didn&amp;#8217;t go so well this&amp;nbsp;year?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not being afraid of the unknown or difficult.&lt;/strong&gt; These first few years of graduate school, if some task took steps that I couldn&amp;#8217;t clearly visualize, or I could see them but I thought they were too hard, I wouldn&amp;#8217;t do it, and my research would suffer as a result. For example, I&amp;#8217;ve been putting off doing a complicated operation on a bunch of sequences that would help my research in ways I can&amp;#8217;t comprehend now, but it was so nebulous to me that I didn&amp;#8217;t even want to attempt it. Or I&amp;#8217;d get some result and not know how to interpret it, and the solution was to go to the literature and read a bunch of papers about those genes, but that&amp;#8217;s too hard so I didn&amp;#8217;t want to do&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blogging.&lt;/strong&gt; I published 10 total blog posts in 2014. I switched to hosting my blog using github.io rather than Tumblr in 2014. I thought my lack of blogging was a result of my blog being on Tumblr and being ugly and annoying to write IPython notebook style blog posts for it, rather than using markdown/IPython entries. I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; have 6 blog posts after September, compared to 4 pre-September, so the change helped. But I still feel I could have blogged more, even small random things I found helpful like that bit about using &lt;a href="http://blog.olgabotvinnik.com/different-branches-different-ipython-notebooks-.html"&gt;different git branches in different IPython notebooks&lt;/a&gt;, which was a great discovery for me in my development workflow. I think part of my lack of posts was also the misguided belief that every post has to be a gigantic, perfectly crafted tome, when it&amp;#8217;s fine to have a concise 100-word&amp;nbsp;post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publishing.&lt;/strong&gt; I didn&amp;#8217;t complete any scientific publications this year. While it&amp;#8217;s not common for a 2nd-year graduate student to publish a paper, I thought I was working hard towards that goal, but in reality, I didn&amp;#8217;t understand the magnitude of work that goes into a publication. I also think my &lt;em&gt;being afraid of the unknown&lt;/em&gt;, not knowing how to do something and being afraid of being wrong, also played into&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regular progress reviews.&lt;/strong&gt; Every once in a while I put together weekly progress reviews of what I did that week and what&amp;#8217;s the plan for the next week. It makes me feel good, and it works for a bit, but then I give it up because I think &amp;#8220;ehh, I&amp;#8217;ll just remember what I need to do.&amp;#8221; I feel I spend too much time on trivial things like reformatting code or making some plot look just slightly better (but not necessarily more readable), rather than moving on to the next&amp;nbsp;thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Python involvement.&lt;/strong&gt; You may wonder why this topic is in both the &amp;#8220;went well&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;didn&amp;#8217;t go so well&amp;#8221; categories. While I&amp;#8217;m happy with my &lt;code&gt;seaborn&lt;/code&gt; contributions, I haven&amp;#8217;t been as happy with other things. There&amp;#8217;s been features I&amp;#8217;ve wanted to add to &lt;a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pandas&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (read gzipped files over the internet) and other visualization features to &lt;code&gt;seaborn&lt;/code&gt;, I haven&amp;#8217;t gotten around to doing them. I did start subscribing to &lt;code&gt;matplotlib-devel&lt;/code&gt; and watching the &lt;code&gt;seaborn&lt;/code&gt; repo for all issues, and replied to a few, but I&amp;#8217;m still afraid that I don&amp;#8217;t have anything to add to the&amp;nbsp;conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sustaining interest.&lt;/strong&gt; As both &lt;a href="http://jamesclear.com/stay-focused"&gt;James Clear&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2009/06/22/on-the-value-of-hard-focus/"&gt;Cal Newport&lt;/a&gt; have discussed, it&amp;#8217;s consistent, sustained effort and focus over a long period of time which generates results. I find it really easy to start something fresh and new, and I struggle with maintaining interest in something long enough to reap the rewards at the&amp;nbsp;end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cello&lt;/strong&gt; Last January I performed a small cello concert for my friends, and worked really hard practicing a lot for it. But this last six months I haven&amp;#8217;t practiced much. Part of it is my teacher had personal commitments that prevented him from teaching for some time, but I think the more major part is that I didn&amp;#8217;t pay for my lessons. I was supposed to help him with his &lt;a href="http://www.celloloftmusic.com/cellosophy/"&gt;Cellosophy&lt;/a&gt; cello app, but honestly I just bit off more than I could chew. The coding was going to be for the instructor website in &lt;a href="http://d3js.org/"&gt;D3.js&lt;/a&gt; and that&amp;#8217;s not part of my core competency, so it was a lot of work for me to just make a bar chart. And so I didn&amp;#8217;t do a good job of collaborating&amp;#8230; and as a result I didn&amp;#8217;t ascribe as much value as I should have to my lessons, and didn&amp;#8217;t invest as much time in them. Once I get back into cello, I&amp;#8217;m going to pay for them. As expensive as they are, they are worth&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fitness&lt;/strong&gt; I was very good about going to yoga and exercising 4+ times a week, but something happened around August and I stopped working out as much. I gained some weight and lost fitness, and I&amp;#8217;m now trying to change that (see next&amp;nbsp;section).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. What am I working&amp;nbsp;toward?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regular progress reviews + Time-boxing.&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#8217;ve started &lt;a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2013/12/21/deep-habits-the-importance-of-planning-every-minute-of-your-work-day/"&gt;planning my workday&lt;/a&gt; carefully in a &lt;a href="http://amzn.com/8867322729?tag=sciencmeetpro-20"&gt;Moleskine daily planner&lt;/a&gt; (in green, my favorite color). This is part of what my colleague &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/leenyann"&gt;Colleen Stoyas&lt;/a&gt; likes to call &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LeenyAnn/status/563335731070771200"&gt;#projectGETONYOGAME&lt;/a&gt;. Writing down how I spend my hours has been a very effective way for me to keep track of where the time goes, especially when it turns out that what I thought was a 30 minute break turned into an hour and a half of eating and chatting&amp;#8230; yikes. I&amp;#8217;m taking the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1585425524/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1585425524&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=sciencmeetpro-20&amp;amp;linkId=PJBK7XP4R2HJIX6N"&gt;Now Habit&lt;/a&gt; approach of not trying to change my habits dramatically, but writing everything down and paying attention to what I&amp;#8217;m doing. Below are some example schedules I&amp;#8217;ve created, for days that went as planned, and others that did not. The images have been blurred for&amp;nbsp;privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a sample day that went quite well, and I mostly stuck to my schedule. You&amp;#8217;ll notice I have some random notes on the side of reminders of people to meet with, and I even drew out a network. However, I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; end up taking a 1.5 hour break from lingering around and chatting, which I probably could have shortened and ended my day&amp;nbsp;earlier.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Below is an example day that didn&amp;#8217;t go as planned, where I started late and thus deviated from the schedule quite a bit. I also got the time wrong for when I was supposed to be teaching data cleaning (2pm not 12pm), so that changed things up too. While this didn&amp;#8217;t go completely as planned, I was able to squeeze a lot of work&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publishing.&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#8217;s hard for me to call a project &amp;#8220;done enough,&amp;#8221; and yet this is exactly what I need to do to be able to publish. I have a couple conference abstract and presentation deadlines coming up in the next few months which will help me to focus on creating &amp;#8220;publishable units.&amp;#8221; Plus I have my advancement in a month, so that will be a big push to get manuscripts ready so I can say that certain projects are at least &amp;#8220;submitted&amp;#8221; to my&amp;nbsp;committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://grad.ucsd.edu/progress/candidacy.html"&gt;Advancing to candidacy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; In our program, the &amp;#8220;Advancement Exam&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;Senate Exam&amp;#8221; is when you show your committee what research you&amp;#8217;ve accomplished so far, and your plan for your PhD. I&amp;#8217;m very nervous for it, and have been doing a lot of background reading to be able to motivate why my projects are important, and why they make sense to be done together. I&amp;#8217;m planning to do this in March, so wish me&amp;nbsp;luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fitness.&lt;/strong&gt; I signed up for my first half-marathon, the &lt;a href="http://www.lajollahalfmarathon.com/"&gt;La Jolla Half Marathon&lt;/a&gt;! I&amp;#8217;ve been training hard for it, maybe a little too hard because I hurt my knee and am resting it now (no running for 1&amp;nbsp;week!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photography.&lt;/strong&gt; I have a bunch of photos I&amp;#8217;ve taken of nature, flowers, architecture, scenery, and LegoLand that I use as backgrounds, and I&amp;#8217;m planning on sharing them as an album. As motivation, I&amp;#8217;m also planning to apply to this year&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2014/09/ubuntu-14-10-wallpaper-contest-winners"&gt;Ubuntu Wallpaper Contest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cello.&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#8217;m going to start scheduling time to play cello, even if its only fifteen minutes, it&amp;#8217;s still an important&amp;nbsp;investment.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="review"></category><category term="personal"></category><category term="professional"></category><category term="productivity"></category></entry></feed>
