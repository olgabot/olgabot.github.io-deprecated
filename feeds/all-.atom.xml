&lt;p&gt;Just like it&amp;#8217;s overly simplistic to let one woman&amp;#8217;s voice stand for all women, I also think it&amp;#8217;s a jump to say that the women on this shirt represent every woman ever. I&amp;#8217;m me, and there&amp;#8217;s no other me, right? I&amp;#8217;m not on this shirt, and I don&amp;#8217;t see my career in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STEM&lt;/span&gt; melting in front of me because of this&amp;nbsp;shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I disagree that this shirt says, as the linked article&amp;nbsp;claims, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every woman working on this project, every woman working on a similar project, every woman working in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STEM&lt;/span&gt;, every woman aspiring to work in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STEM&lt;/span&gt; — this is what I think of you. Every girl dreaming of working in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STEM&lt;/span&gt; someday — this is what I’ll think of you when you’re grown up. Tits and ass. That’s what you are to&amp;nbsp;me.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shirt says, these specific women, on this shirt, are hot and surrounded by awesome sci-fi imagery. These women could be excellent scientists! Their sexiness has nothing to do with how scientifically capable they are. Maybe the models are brilliant engineers, who knows. To me, this is a very limited interpretation of the shirt, &amp;#8220;they are hot therefore they are dumb and incapable of other things,&amp;#8221; which is exactly the kind of interpretation I would like to be&amp;nbsp;combating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you feel offended by this shirt, that&amp;#8217;s your right and I&amp;#8217;ll fight for your right to say that. If he outright said &amp;#8220;No way women could have made this comet landing happen, they&amp;#8217;re too stupid,&amp;#8221; I would completely agree that this person is sexist. However, I personally don&amp;#8217;t feel that this choice of attire represents me at all. I&amp;#8217;m a lot more complex of a ladybeing than what&amp;#8217;s being represented on that garment, and I&amp;#8217;m not going to pretend that what someone else wore is an indication of my own&amp;nbsp;abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; agree it&amp;#8217;s an incredibly distracting shirt, a terrible fashion choice, and he needs a wardrobe upgrade. That&amp;#8217;s the kind of controversy I&amp;#8217;d stand&amp;nbsp;behind.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="social media"></category><category term="feminism"></category></entry></feed>
