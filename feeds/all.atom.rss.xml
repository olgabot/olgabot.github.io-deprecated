But in academia, the currency is not published units but citations of your publications. For someone to not only read your paper but understand and cite it, you need to produce high-quality, readable papers. And that requires deep&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Deep&amp;nbsp;Work&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m an avid reader of &lt;a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/"&gt;Cal Newport&amp;#8217;s blog&lt;/a&gt; where he writes about managing your attention and energy to output high-quality work. I strongly believe that a person&amp;#8217;s work output is directly dependent on the hours they spend in deep work. &amp;#8220;Deep work&amp;#8221; is when you are fully &amp;#8220;in the zone&amp;#8221; - you have notifications turned off on your phone, you aren&amp;#8217;t checking your email or social media, and you are fully engaged in your complex activity. For me those activities could be writing or editing a paper, adding new features to my code, carefully curating a well-designed test dataset, tweaking an explanatory figure to make it more clear, working on an upcoming presentation with a new audience, or doing a new analysis of the&amp;nbsp;data.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help keep track of your deep work, Cal Newport suggests &lt;a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2013/12/21/deep-habits-the-importance-of-planning-every-minute-of-your-work-day/"&gt;planning every minute of your day&lt;/a&gt;. It may sound crazy and obsessive-compulsive, but it really works. What he does is plan his day out on paper and adjust the schedule as things happen. I don&amp;#8217;t like that because then my day looks really messy and I want my &amp;#8220;on-paper&amp;#8221; plan to be an exact record of what actually happened. Instead, I plan my day out on &lt;a href="https://calendar.google.com"&gt;Google Calendar&lt;/a&gt; the day before (during the &amp;#8220;shutdown&amp;#8221; time) and record what actually happened in a &lt;a href="https://www.amazon.com/Moleskine-Daily-Planner-Large-Black/dp/B015NG44KC/ref=dp_ob_title_bk"&gt;Moleskine daily planner&lt;/a&gt; notebook (I love well made stationary products). Japanese pens are my favorite so I use the &lt;a href="http://www.jetpens.com/Uni-ball-Signo-UM-151-Gel-Pens/ct/286"&gt;Uni-ball Signo &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UM&lt;/span&gt;-151&lt;/a&gt; pens from &lt;a href="http://www.jetpens.com/blog/uni-ball-signo-a-comprehensive-guide/pt/639"&gt;JetPens&lt;/a&gt; &amp;#8212; my preferred color is &amp;#8220;Green Black.&amp;#8221; Additionally, I keep a &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt; private GitHub repository containing markdown files for every week, and summarize what I was able to do that&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;My days,&amp;nbsp;step-by-step&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s the step-by-step of my planning rituals, with pointers to the columns of the figure below. The top is a very productive day where even though the plan changed, I still was able to get a lot done (except for those annoying &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UCSD&lt;/span&gt; ethics trainings&amp;#8230;). The bottom is a less productive day that was governed by meetings and talks (including &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/gabepratt/status/801148674499690496"&gt;Aaron Quinlan of &lt;code&gt;bedtools&lt;/code&gt; fame!&lt;/a&gt;) but I was still able to get &lt;em&gt;something&lt;/em&gt; done. These are fairly good examples, the &amp;#8220;bad&amp;#8221; examples (that are less productive) are quite boring - I only wrote down an hour or so of deep work so I&amp;#8217;m too embarassed to show&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/plan_vs_actual-300ppi.png"&gt;&lt;img alt="Planning vs actual outcomes" src="/images/plan_vs_actual-150ppi.png"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the beginning of the week, I create a new markdown file and start filling it in with notes from last week and plans for this week. Sometimes my notes start with a big ole rant about some problem I&amp;#8217;ve been running into, or have a big rolling todo list that I keep updated for the week. (First column - files for each week)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The most important thing about each week&amp;#8217;s file is that each day is a separate section.&lt;/strong&gt; This way, you can keep track of the incremental progress you made that day, and what you hope to accomplish that&amp;nbsp;day. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This is instead of doing project-based organization, which I find makes me less motivated because projects take a long time, so at the project-level, it doesn&amp;#8217;t look like I did much. But if I keep daily progress notes, then I feel better about&amp;nbsp;myself.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Before each day starts, e.g. during &amp;#8220;shutdown&amp;#8221; time the day before (or sometimes on Fridays for the next Monday), I plan out what I want to do on Google Calendar. (Second column - plan for each day)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I find this works quite well because at the beginning of the day, I&amp;#8217;m bursting with energy and want to do &lt;em&gt;all of the things!&lt;/em&gt; But by the end of the day I&amp;#8217;ve realized that I can only do so much, and I&amp;#8217;m much better at prioritizing what&amp;#8217;s important, while at the beginning of the day I&amp;#8217;m much better at &lt;em&gt;doing&lt;/em&gt; things. So planning at the end of the day works for&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I make sure to schedule 30m for &amp;#8220;shutdown&amp;#8221; at the end of the day. If I don&amp;#8217;t do this, the system breaks because I stop planning, and I am at the mercy of my morning impulses, rather than being in control of what I&amp;#8217;m trying to do. Skipping this step breaks the cycle and my system is certain to&amp;nbsp;fail.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Throughout the day, I &amp;#8220;stopwatch&amp;#8221; my time by writing down in my planner the exact minute that I start and stop each activity. (Third column)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I find that the mere act of writing down the time when I start helps me stay focused. When my phone vibrates or something pops into my head, it gets interpreted through the lens of the deep work I&amp;#8217;m currently doing. If it&amp;#8217;s not important to the deep work, it gets ignored or if it&amp;#8217;s urgent, captured (below)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If something comes to mind about an urgent task (e.g. submit travel insurance form), I write it down in my planner or a sticky note so I&amp;#8217;ve captured it, but continue on with my deep work. I do not interrupt my deep&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If I get interrupted, I end the time and start&amp;nbsp;again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;At the end of the day, during &amp;#8220;shutdown,&amp;#8221; I briefly write down what I was able to do in my markdown document and what I hope to do tomorrow (Fourth column), and plan my tomorrow on Google Calendar (Second column). Pretty cyclical,&amp;nbsp;huh?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally I write down the hours and minutes of deep work into the monthly part of the planner.&amp;nbsp;(below)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s where I write the hours and minutes I spent in deep work each day. I find that it helps keep me motivated to sustain the work and get more hours in the next&amp;nbsp;day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="/images/deep_work_monthly_tally.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Monthly tally" src="/images/deep_work_monthly_tally.jpg"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I&amp;#8217;ve found that ~4 hours of deep work is about when I max out, because if I do 5 hours one day, next day I end up doing 2 hours. But 4 hours a day is sustainable. As you can see, December hasn&amp;#8217;t been that productive of a month for me - only about 2-3 hours of deep work a day. The 40m day was one where I was traveling and just didn&amp;#8217;t set aside a time to fully focus and was at the mercy of my&amp;nbsp;impulses.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you first start doing it, you may get frustrated that you&amp;#8217;re not getting much done &amp;#8212; that&amp;#8217;s okay. I get disappointed in myself when I don&amp;#8217;t  Don&amp;#8217;t get frustrated, just keep tracking. Just like any other goal such as losing weight, results don&amp;#8217;t come right&amp;nbsp;away.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Don&amp;#8217;t overdo&amp;nbsp;it&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I work in an &amp;#8220;open office&amp;#8221; environment which makes doing deep work quite difficult as there is constant movement and potential for interruptions around me. Our lab is quite collaborative so there &lt;em&gt;are&lt;/em&gt; times when your input or insight is needed for someone&amp;#8217;s project to go through. I made the mistake of taking this to an extreme and getting very frustrated when people would interrupt me while I was &amp;#8220;in the zone&amp;#8221; and tried to set boundaries but this closed me off from others. As Richard Hamming says in his fabulous talk, &lt;a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/YouAndYourResearch.html"&gt;You and Your Research&lt;/a&gt; about people who closed themselves&amp;nbsp;off:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;I noticed the following facts about people who work with the door open or the door closed. I notice that if you have the door to your office closed, you get more work done today and tomorrow, and you are more productive than most. But 10 years later somehow you don&amp;#8217;t know quite know what problems are worth working on; all the hard work you do is sort of tangential in importance. He who works with the door open gets all kinds of interruptions, but he also occasionally gets clues as to what the world is and what might be important. Now I cannot prove the cause and effect sequence because you might say, &amp;#8220;The closed door is symbolic of a closed mind.&amp;#8221; I don&amp;#8217;t know. But I can say there is a pretty good correlation between those who work with the doors open and those who ultimately do important things, although people who work with doors closed often work harder. Somehow they seem to work on slightly the wrong thing - not much, but enough that they miss&amp;nbsp;fame.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I had to learn to temper this desire to get solid work done and strike a balance between being available and performing intense work. Now, I take lunch off to socialize and chat with the group (rather than working through it), take my headphones off when I am available to work, and when I really need to get work done, I run away and go hide in a place that nobody can find&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Take what works for&amp;nbsp;you&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Productivity is very personal and what works for me may not work for you. I am not trying to say that this is the OneTrueWay(&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TM&lt;/span&gt;) of being productive. This system exploits my love of &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; version control and simple Markdown text files (the &lt;code&gt;self&lt;/code&gt; private github repo), beautiful writing on good paper with nice pens (hence the Moleskine planner and Japanese pens), and flexibility of Google Calendar. My system may seem overwhelming at first because it is the product of many years of trying different things. For me, online tools like Asana and Trello make planning &amp;#8220;too fun&amp;#8221; and get in the way of what I want to do. Writing &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; out on paper makes for an ugly planner with lots of crossing out which I don&amp;#8217;t like. Take the ideas that work for you and leave the ones that don&amp;#8217;t.

conference, which is a conference for neuroscientists, programmers, and
everything in between. It was a unique experience because it had both the
excitement and energy of a tech conference, and the pure, unadulterated zest
for knowledge of a scientific&amp;nbsp;conference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 1: Talks and&amp;nbsp;panel&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first day of the conference started after the workday on Friday at 5pm at
the &lt;a href="http://www.newmuseum.org/"&gt;New Museum&lt;/a&gt; in Little Italy, Manhattan, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYC&lt;/span&gt;.
This was the first time I&amp;#8217;d been to this place and it was really awesome, even
from the outside! Check it out, plus some other photos I took from the&amp;nbsp;conference:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The conference kicked off with some mingling and beer. I gravitated towards the three I knew people coming in to the conference, &lt;a href="http://www.janelia.org/people/scientist/nick-sofroniew"&gt;Nick
Sofroniew&lt;/a&gt;, with whom
I did an &lt;a href="http://www.janelia.org/student-programs/undergraduate-program#722"&gt;undergrad summer program&lt;/a&gt; and invited me to talk, &lt;a href="http://www.jeremyfreeman.net/"&gt;Jeremy Freeman&lt;/a&gt;, the main organizer of
the whole freakin&amp;#8217; thing, and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bensussman"&gt;Ben
Sussman&lt;/a&gt;, who co-taught the &lt;code&gt;gitgoing&lt;/code&gt;
tutorial with me and is an all-around awesome person. But the space was rad,
we had a balcony and a nice view of the city, and I got to meet a bunch of
people doing super interesting things in&amp;nbsp;neuroscience.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got started with the talks, which we had three 10 minute (ish) talks, followed by a half hour (ish) break. It was a nice format that we could chat and break in between the talks not only to get a mental break but also discuss the concepts presented by the previous talks in the context of neuroscience. Here&amp;#8217;s all the&amp;nbsp;talks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Adam Packer (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UCL&lt;/span&gt;): All optical recording and manipulation of individual&amp;nbsp;neurons&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eiman Azim (Columbia): Quantitative behavior and mouse genetics for probing motor circuit&amp;nbsp;function&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Randal Burns (Johns Hopkins): Open Connectome project using &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CATMAID&lt;/span&gt; [&lt;a href="https://github.com/openconnectome/ocpcatmaid"&gt;github repo&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paco Nathan (Databricks): Spark for big&amp;nbsp;data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Eliza Chang (The Data Incubator): PhD to Data&amp;nbsp;Scientist&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Michael Dewar (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYT&lt;/span&gt;): Real-time analytics on streaming data [&lt;a href="https://github.com/mikedewar/codeneuro_streamtools"&gt;github repo for presentation&lt;/a&gt;] | [&lt;a href="https://github.com/nytlabs/streamtools"&gt;github repo for &lt;code&gt;streamtools&lt;/code&gt; package&lt;/a&gt;] &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hilary Parker (Etsy): Data science at Etsy (+&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CodeNeuro/status/586696965502689280"&gt;cute statistical plushies&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Brendan Lake (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYU&lt;/span&gt;): Teaching computers to scribble characters like&amp;nbsp;humans&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Olga Botvinnik, me! (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UCSD&lt;/span&gt;): &lt;code&gt;flotilla&lt;/code&gt;: An open-source Python package for iterative machine learning analyses [&lt;a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/format/slides/gist/olgabot/2ee1087d74df46c842df#/"&gt;slides&lt;/a&gt;]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can imagine from the caliber of all the other talks, I was super nervous for mine! because I&amp;#8217;m not doing things at exabyte scale, I&amp;#8217;m not doing streaming data, and I&amp;#8217;m not even doing neuroscience! I&amp;#8217;m just analyzing static datasets with the usual machine learning algorithms. But as Jeremy pointed out, we need better tools for analyzing the existing non-big data datasets that we have, plus I got great questions and feedback from the talk which was&amp;nbsp;great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My top three favorite talks&amp;nbsp;were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NYT&lt;/span&gt; R&amp;amp;D demo&lt;/strong&gt; This was a fantastic talk about streaming data analytics.  He
and his team had created an interactive way to analyze real-time data. They
had a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GUI&lt;/span&gt; interface where you could select boxes that represented an action on
data (&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extract,_transform,_load"&gt;extract, transform, load aka
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ETL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;-like things), and
you could string these boxes together to create an analysis pipeline. It
reminded me a lot of the &lt;a href="https://usegalaxy.org/"&gt;Galaxy&lt;/a&gt; interface for
reproducible bioinformatics pipelines. Check out the tweet below for a&amp;nbsp;screenshot:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Optogenetics&lt;/strong&gt;. This was a really interesting talk about &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optogenetics"&gt;optogenetics&lt;/a&gt;, which is a way that you can control the brain with light. Researchers genetically insert &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rhodopsin"&gt;rhodopsin&lt;/a&gt;, which is the light-sensitive protein that makes our eyes work, into neurons, which then makes them light sensitive. As a result, you can then turn specific neurons on and off with light! This talk used both this tool of optogenetics to stimulate/inhibit specific neurons, and calcium imaging to record their&amp;nbsp;responses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"&gt;&lt;p&gt;A. Packer shows some amazing tools to simultaneously record + stimulate ensembles of neurons with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CaImaging?src=hash"&gt;#CaImaging&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/optogenetics?src=hash"&gt;#optogenetics&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/codeneuro?src=hash"&gt;#codeneuro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Felipe Gerhard (@neuroflips) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/neuroflips/status/586685623068717056"&gt;April 11, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Spark&lt;/strong&gt;. This was an awesome talk by &lt;a href="http://liber118.com/pxn/"&gt;Paco Nathan&lt;/a&gt;
on using big data tools. Paco had worked with both Hadoop and Spark and gave a
great overview of the history of Big Data (which he pinpointed to Q3 1997),
the different papers about it and tools for it, and where Spark fits in that
ecosystem. He gave a few use cases and was overall just a very entertaining&amp;nbsp;presenter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"&gt;&lt;p&gt;Great talk by &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/placoid"&gt;@placoid&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CodeNeuro"&gt;@CodeNeuro&lt;/a&gt; just now - apparently rotational bearings on planes create 12 exabytes of data / day&amp;#8230; wow &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/bigdata?src=hash"&gt;#bigdata&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Alice Lloyd George (@&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AMLG23&lt;/span&gt;) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/AMLG23/status/586689726196883458"&gt;April 11, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After all the talks, there was a panel led by Jeremy with some giants of
neuroscientists, Tony Movshon, Eve Marder and Larry Abbott. A recurring theme
was that the fundamental questions of how the brain works hasn&amp;#8217;t changed, but
the tools have drastically&amp;nbsp;changed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One story that stuck with me was Eve describing that when she was doing
experiments, she used an
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscilloscope"&gt;oscilloscope&lt;/a&gt; to listen (yes, with
her ears! I thought this was amazing!) to the measurements from neurons, and
there was a direct, phsyical, visceral reaction that when you designed an
experiment and heard specific tones, you knew &lt;strong&gt;exactly&lt;/strong&gt; what that meant,
because you were intimately familiar with the exact tones and sounds produced
by the device. But now, she said, the high throughput methods, while capable
of measuring many things at once, are so detached from the physicality of
neurons firing that she feels people aren&amp;#8217;t connected to what they&amp;#8217;re
measuring anymore. I found that interesting because in my field of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RNA&lt;/span&gt;
biology, we&amp;#8217;ll do these newfangled &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_sequencing#Next-
generation_methods"&gt;high-throughput sequencing
experiments&lt;/a&gt; to measure &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RNA&lt;/span&gt; expression as a proxy for protein
abundance, and study the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alternative_splicing"&gt;alternative
splicing&lt;/a&gt; of these &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RNA&lt;/span&gt;
transcripts, but every time, we always have to validate our findings using an
older, low-throughput method like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Revers
e_transcription_polymerase_chain_reaction"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RT&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PCR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. I don&amp;#8217;t know what the equivalent
experiments are in neuroscience, because it seems all very magical to me that
they&amp;#8217;re able to manipulate individual neurons in mice, but I also wonder if
it&amp;#8217;s known that the neuron in the exact same position in one animal and
another animal, do the exact same thing. So far, biology has relied on laws of
averages, so if you do a high throughput experiment on a bunch of cells and
get an average signal, you should get that same result if you do a low-
throughput version of that experiment. I don&amp;#8217;t know what the equivalent of
that is in neuroscience, but it was refreshing to hear that neuro has its own
share of growing pains as its adopted its own high-throughput techniques, and
that biology wasn&amp;#8217;t the only&amp;nbsp;one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It was interesting to hear about the challenges of neuroscience, of how
excited people are about optogenetics, and how many people are apparently
skeptical of &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_magnetic_resonance_imaging"&gt;functional magentic resonance
imaging&lt;/a&gt;
(fMRI) data, and how nobody knows what the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cerebral_cortex"&gt;cerebral
cortex&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;does!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Day 2: Tutorials +&amp;nbsp;Hackathon&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next morning we were in the &lt;a href="http://www.newinc.org/"&gt;New, Inc&lt;/a&gt; coworking
space, and started off with some kickass bagels and&amp;nbsp;lox/salmon:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"&gt;&lt;p&gt;breakfast begins &lt;a href="http://t.co/55QljXZqkw"&gt;pic.twitter.com/55QljXZqkw&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; CodeNeuro (@CodeNeuro) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CodeNeuro/status/586893786212651008"&gt;April 11, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, people split up about 50/50 for the tutorials and the&amp;nbsp;hackathon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;code&gt;gitgoing&lt;/code&gt; tutorial&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ben Sussman and I taught a tutorial called
&lt;a href="https://github.com/CodeNeuro/gitgoing"&gt;gitgoing&lt;/a&gt; to quickly teach scientists
the version control system
&lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_%28software%29"&gt;&lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and code testing via
&lt;a href="http://pytest.org/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;py.test&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and integration systems via &lt;a href="https://travis-ci.org/"&gt;Travis-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CI&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. We had about 20-30 attendees. The goal was to get the
scientists acquainted with common tools in open source software so that they
could contribute themselves. It was kind of like a mini &lt;a href="http://software-carpentry.org/"&gt;Software
Carpentry&lt;/a&gt; workshop, but we assumed our target
audience had some coding experience, and we didn&amp;#8217;t take the time to explain
computer science fundamentals like variables, loops, flow control,&amp;nbsp;etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our class was structured exactly as laid out in the &lt;code&gt;README.md&lt;/code&gt; file. First we
setup their computers so they had &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; and Python 2.7. This took about an hour
total to get everyone done. Some people finished faster and started moving on to
the &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; section. Then Ben did an awesome explanation of &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt;, and I learned a
bunch of stuff! I didn&amp;#8217;t realize that when you &lt;code&gt;git clone&lt;/code&gt; a repo, you&amp;#8217;re
getting &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ENTIRE&lt;/span&gt; history of the project, so that makes sense why downloading all
of &lt;a href="ipython.org"&gt;IPython&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href="https://jupyter.org/"&gt;Jupyter&lt;/a&gt; takes forever. It was
also a really helpful analogy to describe the entire repository as an &amp;#8220;ocean of
code,&amp;#8221; and that a branch is a single window into that ocean. We also talked
about merge conflicts, and how they can be really easy to create if, say someone
renamed one of the arguments of a function, and someone else added an argument,
and then &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; doesn&amp;#8217;t know what to do anymore. They picked up on testing pretty
quickly, and someone asked &amp;#8220;well &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; thinks it&amp;#8217;s okay, but how do you know
the code will run?&amp;#8221; Which brought us directly to&amp;nbsp;testing!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, I talked about testing and why it&amp;#8217;s important. I wrote some simple Python
code with functions like &lt;code&gt;mean_plus_one&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;std_plus_one&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;cv&lt;/code&gt; (coefficient
of variance). They were just slight variations on the true
&lt;a href="http://www.numpy.org/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;numpy&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; functions so the learners couldn&amp;#8217;t just use the
&lt;code&gt;numpy&lt;/code&gt; version. We looked at the test file, &lt;code&gt;test_gitgoing.py&lt;/code&gt; which used
&lt;code&gt;py.test&lt;/code&gt;&lt;span class="quo"&gt;&amp;#8216;&lt;/span&gt;s fixtures, which take care of the &lt;code&gt;setUp&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;tearDown&lt;/code&gt; methods that
some other testing frameworks have. We saw a simple example of fixtures, which
creates a 20x10 matrix of normally distributed random numbers. These could have
been set as integers, I just wanted to illustrate how you can create new
fixtures from existing&amp;nbsp;ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;numpy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;pytest&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@pytest.fixture&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;n_rows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;20&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@pytest.fixture&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;n_cols&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;():&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="nd"&gt;@pytest.fixture&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;def&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nf"&gt;x_norm&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n_rows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;n_cols&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="k"&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;randn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;n_rows&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;n_cols&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;There is a commented out broken test in the repo which they had to fix, which was a great formative assessment because they had to use their newly formed &lt;code&gt;git&lt;/code&gt; and testing knowledge to fix the test, commit the changes, make a branch of their &amp;#8220;feature&amp;#8221; fixing the test, pushing to the branch, and making a pull request to the master branch. It was really rewarding for the students to see their pull request on Github, and to see their commits on the network of contributors to the &lt;code&gt;gitgoing&lt;/code&gt; repo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We unfortunately didn&amp;#8217;t advertise the #gitgoing hashtag before the tutorial so we didn&amp;#8217;t get any live-tweets, but Ben and I mitigated this and took a picture&amp;nbsp;afterwards:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/gitgoing?src=hash"&gt;#gitgoing&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/CodeNeuro"&gt;@CodeNeuro&lt;/a&gt;! Thanks &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/bensussman"&gt;@bensussman&lt;/a&gt; for being an awesome co-teacher and everyone for coming! &lt;a href="http://t.co/l0BUhoeWja"&gt;pic.twitter.com/l0BUhoeWja&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Olga Botvinnik (@olgabot) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/olgabot/status/586980895397019650"&gt;April 11, 2015&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"&gt;&lt;/script&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Spark&amp;nbsp;tutorial&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the &lt;code&gt;gitgoing&lt;/code&gt; tutorial we had a break and mingled. Then, I went to the Spark tutorial, taught by &lt;a href="http://liber118.com/pxn/"&gt;Paco Nathan&lt;/a&gt; from &lt;a href="https://databricks.com/"&gt;DataBricks&lt;/a&gt; (slides &lt;a href="http://training.databricks.com/workshop/dbc_intro.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;). I&amp;#8217;ve seen Spark demos before but I haven&amp;#8217;t put in the time to play around with the tools, so this was a great way to get&amp;nbsp;exposed!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was a little late to the tutorial, so I missed the initial setup. I was handed a slip of paper with a url, username and password that was my personal login to the DataBricks cloud. Paco was doing a &amp;#8220;preflight check&amp;#8221; of explaining different Spark concepts before we dove in. The key things I took away&amp;nbsp;were:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RDD&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: Resilient Distributed Dataset. This is the core unit of a spark analysis, where you load in data, and use Spark to indicate that you want it to be&amp;nbsp;parallelized.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;code&gt;sc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;: &amp;#8220;Spark context.&amp;#8221; This is the object that exists in all the Python library versions with Spark, and is the object that you will be using to create and operate on&amp;nbsp;datasets. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We used an IPython notebook-style &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;REPL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; interface, which was really nice because we could see the output from our commands right away. We continued with learning how&amp;nbsp;to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Read text files and separate lines by&amp;nbsp;tabs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Filter for the first word of the line to be &lt;code&gt;ERROR&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Get all the second words of the error&amp;nbsp;lines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Find the errors that were caused by &lt;code&gt;"mysql"&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can see a summary of my notes for this first section&amp;nbsp;here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lines&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;textFile&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;/mnt/paco/intro/error_log.txt&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; \
  &lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;lambda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;split&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\t&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;lines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;lambda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;==&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;ERROR&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;messages&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;errors&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;lambda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;])&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;messages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;lambda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;mysql&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# At this point, the data is loaded into memory on the workers and you don&amp;#39;t&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# need to attack disk again, so this operation is very fast&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;messages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;filter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="k"&gt;lambda&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;find&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;php&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;count&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Yay, we learned how to read files! Always good&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The next part of the tutorial, we learned how to use &lt;code&gt;flatMap&lt;/code&gt;, and then how to &lt;code&gt;join&lt;/code&gt; several RDDs on their &lt;code&gt;(key, value)&lt;/code&gt; pairs. After the break, we had a mini lecture about &amp;#8220;Computational thinking&amp;#8221; where we had to use what we learned so far to find all the instances of the word &amp;#8220;Spark&amp;#8221; in two files. If you&amp;#8217;re interested, you can see my full notes &lt;a href="https://gist.github.com/olgabot/ab058876b3bda6198f25"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Hackathon&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The hackathon was centered around the &lt;a href="http://codeneuro.org/neurofinder/"&gt;neurofinder&lt;/a&gt; challenge, which is to try and extract neuronal signals from Calcium imaging data. The goals were&amp;nbsp;go:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refine a standardized &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; for &amp;#8220;source extraction&amp;#8221; algorithms, including input/ouptut&amp;nbsp;formats&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work on evaluation metrics for algorithms and agree on ground truth&amp;nbsp;definition&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work on incorporating existing algorithms into this &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Work on the frontend/backend of a website that would automatically run submitted algorithms on the test data, get the results and upload them to a&amp;nbsp;leaderboard&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, everyone introduced themselves and the group organically split into a few groups: the website, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; input/output formatting, implementing algorithms, and designing&amp;nbsp;metrics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The website team was composed of five people with web development frontend/backend experience. They generated some prototype websites and code, all available on &lt;a href="https://github.com/codeneuro/neurofinder"&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;, and hopefully launching in beta&amp;nbsp;soon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another group of about 25 worked on the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt; and the input/output formats, with their final notes added to &lt;a href="https://github.com/CodeNeuro/neurofinder/wiki"&gt;this wiki&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another group of 10-20 split to work on incorporating existing algorithms in to this &lt;span class="caps"&gt;API&lt;/span&gt;. The rest worked on defining evaluation metrics for algorithms and the &amp;#8220;ground truth&amp;#8221; definitions of &amp;#8220;what is a neuron&amp;#8221; for these methods. They implemented some evaluation metrics, and developed an initial ground truth definition of manual centers and morphological boundaries. They discussed that this initial &amp;#8220;ground truth&amp;#8221; risks circularity, but is still a solid&amp;nbsp;start.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There were still people working well into the&amp;nbsp;evening!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I read the &lt;a href="http://the-toast.net/2015/04/01/things-male-tech-colleagues-have-actually-said-annotated/"&gt;things my male tech colleagues have said to me&lt;/a&gt; article and thought about my own experience.

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;You don&amp;#8217;t look like you&amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;&amp;#8220;Most girls aren&amp;#8217;t &amp;#8230;&amp;#8221;&lt;/strong&gt;* Boston is a melting pot of colleges and you&amp;#8217;ll often start conversations at parties with, &amp;#8220;What school do you go to?&amp;#8221; I got tired of hearing &amp;#8220;You don&amp;#8217;t look like you {go to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MIT&lt;/span&gt;, major in math/eng}&amp;#8221; when guys asked me this at parties in college, so my friend and I started to respond with &amp;#8220;guess&amp;#8221; when asked, and they were usually taken aback. They&amp;#8217;d say &amp;#8220;Well only &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MIT&lt;/span&gt; girls would say that, so you must go to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MIT&lt;/span&gt;.&amp;#8221; At least I turned it around on&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting mixed up with receptionists.&lt;/strong&gt; First of all, being a receptionist/administrative assistant is a difficult and thankless job. You are constantly behind the scenes making sure everything is running smoothly and taking care of all kinds of tasks that nobody else wants to do. It&amp;#8217;s hard work. That said, it&amp;#8217;s unfortunate that these positions are seen as low-skill and as such, only for eye-candy women who aren&amp;#8217;t good for anything else. I&amp;#8217;m not a receptionist, and you should respect (not assume) my career choices as well as the&amp;nbsp;receptionist&amp;#8217;s.&lt;/li&gt;

So I&amp;#8217;m going to follow his template with the following three&amp;nbsp;questions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What went well this&amp;nbsp;year?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What didn’t go so well this&amp;nbsp;year?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;What am I working&amp;nbsp;toward?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;1. What went well this&amp;nbsp;year?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fellowships.&lt;/strong&gt; This year, I was the first and sole recipient of the &lt;a href="http://numfocus.org/news/2014/07/01/john-hunter-technology-fellowship-awarded/"&gt;NumFOCUS John Hunter Technology Fellowship&lt;/a&gt;. I was thrilled to receive it, especially because I thought I had no chance of getting it. From the wording of the announcement, which said &amp;#8220;postdoctoral scientists or senior graduate students,&amp;#8221; I thought I wasn&amp;#8217;t seasoned enough, and I figured people who work on &lt;a href="http://scikit-learn.org/stable/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;scikit-learn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://ipython.org/"&gt;IPython&lt;/a&gt; would apply and definitely get it over me. Plus I couldn&amp;#8217;t think of anyone who would be willing to be my Software Mentor, as required for the application. Thankfully, at &lt;a href="https://us.pycon.org/2014/"&gt;PyCon&lt;/a&gt;, I was talking to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ctitusbrown"&gt;Titus Brown&lt;/a&gt; and mentioned that I wanted to apply to this fellowship but thought I wouldn&amp;#8217;t get it, and that didn&amp;#8217;t have a Software Mentor. Immediately, he dismissed my doubts and offered be my Software Mentor, on the spot! I almost cried because I was so happy and surprised to hear someone believe in me so strongly, especially because for the previous year I had been getting major shade and negativity from certain peers back home, which majorly impacted my mental state and made me feel constantly&amp;nbsp;inadequate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Python involvement.&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#8217;m very proud to have contributed to the &lt;a href="http://web.stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/index.html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;seaborn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; statistical data visualization Python package, specifically creating the first-ever (that I know of) single-line clustered heatmap function in Python! It was months of work, and couldn&amp;#8217;t have been done without the input from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/mike_t_lovci"&gt;Mike Lovci&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/cdeboever3"&gt;Christopher DeBoever&lt;/a&gt;. Plus now I have more clout to evangelize Python for bioinformatics research&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Passed Qualifying Exam!&lt;/strong&gt; On May 15th, 2014, I proved my competency to a group of three professors, who all agreed that I can move on to the next stage of graduate school! I spent a solid month writing and working on my presentation and was &lt;strong&gt;very&lt;/strong&gt; nervous and stressed about it, so it was very satisfying to be&amp;nbsp;over.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Travel and conferences&lt;/strong&gt; Last year I traveled&amp;nbsp;to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Strata 2014 in Santa Clara,&amp;nbsp;California&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PyCon 2014 in Montreal,&amp;nbsp;Canada&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Post-quals vacation in Cabo San Lucas,&amp;nbsp;Mexico&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Single-cell genomics conference in Stockholm, Sweden. Plus Italy (Rome and Venice)&amp;nbsp;afterwards&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;PyData 2014 (&lt;a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IQksDvFl2_8"&gt;gave a talk!&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s been a great experience to visit these places and make new friends in the Python, data science, and single-cell communities. Looking forward to more this&amp;nbsp;year!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photography&lt;/strong&gt; While I haven&amp;#8217;t publicly shared much photography, I&amp;#8217;ve taken lots of photos on these different trips. The Europe trip was especially good, because I purposely tested out different settings in low light and other tough situations, and I spent a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LOT&lt;/span&gt; of time watching LightRoom tutorials on editing, and learned a lot of new techniques that I&amp;#8217;ve been practicing with new&amp;nbsp;photos.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Personal relationships.&lt;/strong&gt; I had some tough interpersonal issues this year and in talking through it with a friend, they recommended the book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Difficult-Conversations-Discuss-What-Matters/dp/0143118447"&gt;Difficult Conversations&lt;/a&gt;. I highly recommend this book to everyone, because difficult conversations happen every day, and this will provide you the tools and perspectives you need to understand them. I can honestly say that the book has changed my life and helped me critically evaluate everyone&amp;#8217;s role in a tricky spot, and come up with strategies in how to approach these situations tactfully. Tact has never been my strong suit, so these lessons were&amp;nbsp;eye-opening.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;2. What didn&amp;#8217;t go so well this&amp;nbsp;year?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Not being afraid of the unknown or difficult.&lt;/strong&gt; These first few years of graduate school, if some task took steps that I couldn&amp;#8217;t clearly visualize, or I could see them but I thought they were too hard, I wouldn&amp;#8217;t do it, and my research would suffer as a result. For example, I&amp;#8217;ve been putting off doing a complicated operation on a bunch of sequences that would help my research in ways I can&amp;#8217;t comprehend now, but it was so nebulous to me that I didn&amp;#8217;t even want to attempt it. Or I&amp;#8217;d get some result and not know how to interpret it, and the solution was to go to the literature and read a bunch of papers about those genes, but that&amp;#8217;s too hard so I didn&amp;#8217;t want to do&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Blogging.&lt;/strong&gt; I published 10 total blog posts in 2014. I switched to hosting my blog using github.io rather than Tumblr in 2014. I thought my lack of blogging was a result of my blog being on Tumblr and being ugly and annoying to write IPython notebook style blog posts for it, rather than using markdown/IPython entries. I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; have 6 blog posts after September, compared to 4 pre-September, so the change helped. But I still feel I could have blogged more, even small random things I found helpful like that bit about using &lt;a href="http://blog.olgabotvinnik.com/different-branches-different-ipython-notebooks-.html"&gt;different git branches in different IPython notebooks&lt;/a&gt;, which was a great discovery for me in my development workflow. I think part of my lack of posts was also the misguided belief that every post has to be a gigantic, perfectly crafted tome, when it&amp;#8217;s fine to have a concise 100-word&amp;nbsp;post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publishing.&lt;/strong&gt; I didn&amp;#8217;t complete any scientific publications this year. While it&amp;#8217;s not common for a 2nd-year graduate student to publish a paper, I thought I was working hard towards that goal, but in reality, I didn&amp;#8217;t understand the magnitude of work that goes into a publication. I also think my &lt;em&gt;being afraid of the unknown&lt;/em&gt;, not knowing how to do something and being afraid of being wrong, also played into&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regular progress reviews.&lt;/strong&gt; Every once in a while I put together weekly progress reviews of what I did that week and what&amp;#8217;s the plan for the next week. It makes me feel good, and it works for a bit, but then I give it up because I think &amp;#8220;ehh, I&amp;#8217;ll just remember what I need to do.&amp;#8221; I feel I spend too much time on trivial things like reformatting code or making some plot look just slightly better (but not necessarily more readable), rather than moving on to the next&amp;nbsp;thing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Python involvement.&lt;/strong&gt; You may wonder why this topic is in both the &amp;#8220;went well&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;didn&amp;#8217;t go so well&amp;#8221; categories. While I&amp;#8217;m happy with my &lt;code&gt;seaborn&lt;/code&gt; contributions, I haven&amp;#8217;t been as happy with other things. There&amp;#8217;s been features I&amp;#8217;ve wanted to add to &lt;a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pandas&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (read gzipped files over the internet) and other visualization features to &lt;code&gt;seaborn&lt;/code&gt;, I haven&amp;#8217;t gotten around to doing them. I did start subscribing to &lt;code&gt;matplotlib-devel&lt;/code&gt; and watching the &lt;code&gt;seaborn&lt;/code&gt; repo for all issues, and replied to a few, but I&amp;#8217;m still afraid that I don&amp;#8217;t have anything to add to the&amp;nbsp;conversation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sustaining interest.&lt;/strong&gt; As both &lt;a href="http://jamesclear.com/stay-focused"&gt;James Clear&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2009/06/22/on-the-value-of-hard-focus/"&gt;Cal Newport&lt;/a&gt; have discussed, it&amp;#8217;s consistent, sustained effort and focus over a long period of time which generates results. I find it really easy to start something fresh and new, and I struggle with maintaining interest in something long enough to reap the rewards at the&amp;nbsp;end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cello&lt;/strong&gt; Last January I performed a small cello concert for my friends, and worked really hard practicing a lot for it. But this last six months I haven&amp;#8217;t practiced much. Part of it is my teacher had personal commitments that prevented him from teaching for some time, but I think the more major part is that I didn&amp;#8217;t pay for my lessons. I was supposed to help him with his &lt;a href="http://www.celloloftmusic.com/cellosophy/"&gt;Cellosophy&lt;/a&gt; cello app, but honestly I just bit off more than I could chew. The coding was going to be for the instructor website in &lt;a href="http://d3js.org/"&gt;D3.js&lt;/a&gt; and that&amp;#8217;s not part of my core competency, so it was a lot of work for me to just make a bar chart. And so I didn&amp;#8217;t do a good job of collaborating&amp;#8230; and as a result I didn&amp;#8217;t ascribe as much value as I should have to my lessons, and didn&amp;#8217;t invest as much time in them. Once I get back into cello, I&amp;#8217;m going to pay for them. As expensive as they are, they are worth&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fitness&lt;/strong&gt; I was very good about going to yoga and exercising 4+ times a week, but something happened around August and I stopped working out as much. I gained some weight and lost fitness, and I&amp;#8217;m now trying to change that (see next&amp;nbsp;section).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;3. What am I working&amp;nbsp;toward?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regular progress reviews + Time-boxing.&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;#8217;ve started &lt;a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2013/12/21/deep-habits-the-importance-of-planning-every-minute-of-your-work-day/"&gt;planning my workday&lt;/a&gt; carefully in a &lt;a href="http://amzn.com/8867322729?tag=sciencmeetpro-20"&gt;Moleskine daily planner&lt;/a&gt; (in green, my favorite color). This is part of what my colleague &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/leenyann"&gt;Colleen Stoyas&lt;/a&gt; likes to call &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LeenyAnn/status/563335731070771200"&gt;#projectGETONYOGAME&lt;/a&gt;. Writing down how I spend my hours has been a very effective way for me to keep track of where the time goes, especially when it turns out that what I thought was a 30 minute break turned into an hour and a half of eating and chatting&amp;#8230; yikes. I&amp;#8217;m taking the &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1585425524/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;camp=1789&amp;amp;creative=390957&amp;amp;creativeASIN=1585425524&amp;amp;linkCode=as2&amp;amp;tag=sciencmeetpro-20&amp;amp;linkId=PJBK7XP4R2HJIX6N"&gt;Now Habit&lt;/a&gt; approach of not trying to change my habits dramatically, but writing everything down and paying attention to what I&amp;#8217;m doing. Below are some example schedules I&amp;#8217;ve created, for days that went as planned, and others that did not. The images have been blurred for&amp;nbsp;privacy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s a sample day that went quite well, and I mostly stuck to my schedule. You&amp;#8217;ll notice I have some random notes on the side of reminders of people to meet with, and I even drew out a network. However, I &lt;em&gt;did&lt;/em&gt; end up taking a 1.5 hour break from lingering around and chatting, which I probably could have shortened and ended my day&amp;nbsp;earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://imgur.com/3FbYHIa"&gt;&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/3FbYHIa.jpg" alt="Example hour plan for a day that went mostly as planned" style="width: 200px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is an example day that didn&amp;#8217;t go as planned, where I started late and thus deviated from the schedule quite a bit. I also got the time wrong for when I was supposed to be teaching data cleaning (2pm not 12pm), so that changed things up too. While this didn&amp;#8217;t go completely as planned, I was able to squeeze a lot of work&amp;nbsp;in.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://imgur.com/iNcLFjg"&gt;&lt;img src="http://i.imgur.com/iNcLFjg.jpg" alt="Example hour plan for a day that didn't go as planned" style="width: 200px;"/&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Publishing.&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#8217;s hard for me to call a project &amp;#8220;done enough,&amp;#8221; and yet this is exactly what I need to do to be able to publish. I have a couple conference abstract and presentation deadlines coming up in the next few months which will help me to focus on creating &amp;#8220;publishable units.&amp;#8221; Plus I have my advancement in a month, so that will be a big push to get manuscripts ready so I can say that certain projects are at least &amp;#8220;submitted&amp;#8221; to my&amp;nbsp;committee.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href="http://grad.ucsd.edu/progress/candidacy.html"&gt;Advancing to candidacy&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt; In our program, the &amp;#8220;Advancement Exam&amp;#8221; or &amp;#8220;Senate Exam&amp;#8221; is when you show your committee what research you&amp;#8217;ve accomplished so far, and your plan for your PhD. I&amp;#8217;m very nervous for it, and have been doing a lot of background reading to be able to motivate why my projects are important, and why they make sense to be done together. I&amp;#8217;m planning to do this in March, so wish me&amp;nbsp;luck!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fitness.&lt;/strong&gt; I signed up for my first half-marathon, the &lt;a href="http://www.lajollahalfmarathon.com/"&gt;La Jolla Half Marathon&lt;/a&gt;! I&amp;#8217;ve been training hard for it, maybe a little too hard because I hurt my knee and am resting it now (no running for 1&amp;nbsp;week!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Photography.&lt;/strong&gt; I have a bunch of photos I&amp;#8217;ve taken of nature, flowers, architecture, scenery, and LegoLand that I use as backgrounds, and I&amp;#8217;m planning on sharing them as an album. As motivation, I&amp;#8217;m also planning to apply to this year&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2014/09/ubuntu-14-10-wallpaper-contest-winners"&gt;Ubuntu Wallpaper Contest&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today I taught a 1-hour lesson on &amp;#8220;Cleaning data&amp;#8221; for graduate students in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UCSD&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BIOM262&lt;/span&gt;: Quantitative Methods in Genetics class. Here is the &lt;a href="http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/olgabot/edebccd736d051d8a1c7"&gt;IPython notebook&lt;/a&gt; that I used. While designing the lesson, I used concepts I learned from &lt;a href="http://software-carpentry.org/"&gt;Software Carpentry&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;s &lt;a href="http://teaching.software-carpentry.org/"&gt;Training for instructors&lt;/a&gt;, such&amp;nbsp;as:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Designing the lesson incrementally, so every step builds upon&amp;nbsp;itself&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When designing a lesson, have the final task in mind and teach to&amp;nbsp;that&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Being as clear as possible for each&amp;nbsp;step&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the workshop, I again implemented things we learned in software carpentry, such as working in pairs and using stickie notes to indicate progress. Overall, I thought it went quite well, with students being engaged for most of the time. Here&amp;#8217;s the results of what went well and what could be&amp;nbsp;improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Good&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the things I thought went&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Everyone worked in pairs&lt;/strong&gt;. Before we split into pairs, I surveyed the class to check for previous experience with &lt;a href="http://www.python.org/"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://ipython.org/"&gt;IPython Notebook&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/"&gt;pandas&lt;/a&gt;. Then, the person who has &lt;strong&gt;less&lt;/strong&gt; experience was the one who did all the typing (aka &amp;#8220;driving&amp;#8221; in pair-programming parlance), and the more experienced person wasn&amp;#8217;t allowed to type. We did this at the software carpentry training while doing a &lt;a href="https://github.com/"&gt;Github&lt;/a&gt; exercise. I paired with someone who was less experienced with Github, and it was a good experience for me to have to sit on my hands and talk through every step. This was very useful because the more experienced person had to be explicit and describe every step, and the less experienced person automatically had a mentor to ask &amp;#8220;dumb&amp;#8221; questions to, without having to grab an instructor. An additional benefit is that when working in pairs, you&amp;#8217;re held more accountable, so you can&amp;#8217;t just do some exercises and then switch to your email or facebook, because your partner is right&amp;nbsp;there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Used pink and blue stickies to show progress.&lt;/strong&gt; Pink was &amp;#8220;still working&amp;#8221; and blue was &amp;#8220;done.&amp;#8221; This was helpful to be able to scan the room and get a sense of the progress. We used this at software carpentry as well, but it was definitely more helpful as an instructor than as a student, because you got an implicit sense of progress, without having to check in personally with&amp;nbsp;everyone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s what the students said they&amp;nbsp;liked.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In-class verbal feedback (everyone has to give one feedback, alternate good and bad, no repeats)&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working in&amp;nbsp;pairs &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hands-on&amp;nbsp;activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cleanly&amp;nbsp;organized&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Could go at your own&amp;nbsp;pace&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;My partner was very&amp;nbsp;helpful!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learned&amp;nbsp;IPython&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anonymous written feedback. All of these are direct quotes.&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thorough&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Progressive - ideas built upon each other&amp;nbsp;well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Paired&amp;nbsp;activity&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;This was a great session - should have done this in the first week. Your tutorial was &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EXCELLENT&lt;/span&gt;. It would be nice to have this introduced earlier, in this manner. You&amp;#8217;re a great instructor. Great job and thank&amp;nbsp;you!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very nice. Work on IPython&amp;nbsp;exercises.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very well put together exercise, referenceable for the&amp;nbsp;future&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Very practical&amp;nbsp;skills&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Step by step instructions with logic very&amp;nbsp;helpful&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Awesome worksheet, really well made. My favorite parts were the ones that made me think harder, so the worksheet could be even&amp;nbsp;harder.&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Good instructions on&amp;nbsp;platform&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easy to&amp;nbsp;follow&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;IPython&amp;nbsp;format&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Thanks for your patience! I liked the tutorial a lot! Using IPython is fun&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The steps and instructions were clear and built on each other. I would be happy if all homework was set up in this&amp;nbsp;way.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Bad&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The instructions for getting set up with downloading an IPython notebook, and having to &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; and navigate to that directory, and start up an IPython notebook were confusing and need to be rewritten or completely reworked. Maybe give them a &lt;code&gt;wget&lt;/code&gt; or similar command? Then they&amp;#8217;ll be directly in that folder where the &lt;code&gt;.ipynb&lt;/code&gt; was downloaded to, and don&amp;#8217;t have to do any navigation. This took up a good 15 minutes at the beginning, that could have been used on programming&amp;nbsp;instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows was a much larger impediment than I thought. The first part of the lesson was performing Unix commands such as &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;tail&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;wc&lt;/code&gt;, and searching for a command to count the number of columns in a file (ends up being either &lt;code&gt;awk&lt;/code&gt; or a combo of &lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;wc&lt;/code&gt;). I didn&amp;#8217;t plan for this, or test the lesson on a Windows machine, but half the class was using Windows. So that&amp;#8217;s definitely something I will plan for in the future. I felt really&amp;nbsp;bad.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;#8217;s what the students said could be&amp;nbsp;improved.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In-class verbal feedback&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Felt rushed for&amp;nbsp;me&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Show the results on my computer, as well as hands&amp;nbsp;on&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hard to get started without the right&amp;nbsp;programs&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;too much help&lt;/strong&gt; in the instructions [This one took me off&amp;nbsp;guard!]&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Windows&amp;nbsp;:(&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;No Memes&amp;nbsp;:(&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Anonymous written feedback&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Bad. Windows machines.&amp;nbsp;Bad&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Would be nice to work with genomics&amp;nbsp;data&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It&amp;#8217;s hard for me not to be the&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;driver&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Umm, too much&amp;nbsp;feedback?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hard to find equivalent commands for Windows on my own because I don&amp;#8217;t know how to parse through other people&amp;#8217;s tips and know which one will work or not. Not your fault&amp;nbsp;though!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;There should be resources and instructions on how to make this applicable to our own&amp;nbsp;work&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Ugly&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Windows&amp;nbsp;:(&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="teaching"></category><category term="python"></category><category term="programming"></category></entry><entry><title>Re: “Shirtgate”</title><link href="/re-shirtgate-.html" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-11-16T11:28:00-08:00</published><updated>2014-11-16T11:28:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Olga Botvinnik</name></author><id>tag:None,2014-11-16:/re-shirtgate-.html</id><summary type="html"></summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Re &lt;a href="http://www.rawstory.com/rs/2014/11/a-pornographer-and-atheist-explains-why-the-science-guys-shirt-crash-landed/"&gt;&amp;#8220;shirtgate&amp;#8221;&lt;/a&gt; (link is to a reasonable summary and rebuttal that I don&amp;#8217;t completely agree&amp;nbsp;with.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just like it&amp;#8217;s overly simplistic to let one woman&amp;#8217;s voice stand for all women, I also think it&amp;#8217;s a jump to say that the women on this shirt represent every woman ever. I&amp;#8217;m me, and there&amp;#8217;s no other me, right? I&amp;#8217;m not on this shirt, and I don&amp;#8217;t see my career in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STEM&lt;/span&gt; melting in front of me because of this&amp;nbsp;shirt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I disagree that this shirt says, as the linked article&amp;nbsp;claims, &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Every woman working on this project, every woman working on a similar project, every woman working in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STEM&lt;/span&gt;, every woman aspiring to work in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STEM&lt;/span&gt; — this is what I think of you. Every girl dreaming of working in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;STEM&lt;/span&gt; someday — this is what I’ll think of you when you’re grown up. Tits and ass. That’s what you are to&amp;nbsp;me.” &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This shirt says, these specific women, on this shirt, are hot and surrounded by awesome sci-fi imagery. These women could be excellent scientists! Their sexiness has nothing to do with how scientifically capable they are. Maybe the models are brilliant engineers, who knows. To me, this is a very limited interpretation of the shirt, &amp;#8220;they are hot therefore they are dumb and incapable of other things,&amp;#8221; which is exactly the kind of interpretation I would like to be&amp;nbsp;combating.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you feel offended by this shirt, that&amp;#8217;s your right and I&amp;#8217;ll fight for your right to say that. If he outright said &amp;#8220;No way women could have made this comet landing happen, they&amp;#8217;re too stupid,&amp;#8221; I would completely agree that this person is sexist. However, I personally don&amp;#8217;t feel that this choice of attire represents me at all. I&amp;#8217;m a lot more complex of a ladybeing than what&amp;#8217;s being represented on that garment, and I&amp;#8217;m not going to pretend that what someone else wore is an indication of my own&amp;nbsp;abilities.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I &lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; agree it&amp;#8217;s an incredibly distracting shirt, a terrible fashion choice, and he needs a wardrobe upgrade. That&amp;#8217;s the kind of controversy I&amp;#8217;d stand&amp;nbsp;behind.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="social media"></category><category term="feminism"></category></entry><entry><title>No longer actively developing prettyplotlib</title><link href="/blog/2014/10/06/no-longer-actively-developing-prettyplotlib/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2014-10-06T10:10:39-07:00</published><updated>2014-10-06T10:10:39-07:00</updated><author><name>Olga Botvinnik</name></author><id>tag:None,2014-10-06:/blog/2014/10/06/no-longer-actively-developing-prettyplotlib/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;It is with heavy heart that I announce that I am no longer actively developing &lt;a href="https://github.com/olgabot/prettyplotlib"&gt;&lt;code&gt;prettyplotlib&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.

It was a fantastic experience to bundle up that piece of code and share it with the world, and discover that there are many other people who want pretty plots. Over the last year, I discovered a much better visualization library in Python called &lt;a href="https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn"&gt;&lt;code&gt;seaborn&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, which is much more mature and covers more ground than &lt;code&gt;prettyplotlib&lt;/code&gt; ever could. From working on &lt;a href="https://github.com/mwaskom/seaborn/pull/230"&gt;clustered heatmaps&lt;/a&gt; on &lt;code&gt;seaborn&lt;/code&gt;, I&amp;#8217;ve become a much better Python programmer, and am forever grateful to &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/michaelwaskom"&gt;Michael Waskom&lt;/a&gt; for creating&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;seaborn&lt;/code&gt;, to get the &lt;code&gt;prettyplotlib&lt;/code&gt; style,&amp;nbsp;do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;seaborn&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;sns&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;sns&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;set&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;style&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;ticks&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;palette&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Set2&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And to remove &amp;#8220;chartjunk&amp;#8221;,&amp;nbsp;do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;sns.despine()
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you have discrete pull requests, I will accept them, but I personally will no longer fix&amp;nbsp;bugs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Write posts in Markdown and IPython notebooks so figures, code, and LaTeX markup would show up&amp;nbsp;fine.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Easily back up my posts. Before, I wrote my posts in &lt;a href="http://simplenote.com/"&gt;Simplenote&lt;/a&gt; and then copy-pasted to Tumblr, but I didn&amp;#8217;t like&amp;nbsp;that.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I don&amp;#8217;t use the re-blogging or following aspects of Tumblr much so I didn&amp;#8217;t see the advantages of that&amp;nbsp;network.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Awesome &lt;a href="http://www.pelicanthemes.com/"&gt;customizable themes&lt;/a&gt; using&amp;nbsp;Pelican.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a few drawbacks, most notably, the comments from previous posts are still tied to the Tumblr website, because Tumblr doesn&amp;#8217;t use slugs (e.g. &amp;#8220;&lt;code&gt;migration-to-github-io&lt;/code&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;) for its webpage names, instead it uses some random number generator for keeping track of posts, e.g &amp;#8220;post/72680703972&amp;#8221;. And because &lt;a href="https://disqus.com/"&gt;Disqus&lt;/a&gt; uses the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;URL&lt;/span&gt; from the post to map it back to its database, and I couldn&amp;#8217;t get the original mapping :( So comments for old posts will be back on&amp;nbsp;Tumblr.&lt;/p&gt;

I spend most of my time talking to a few people who study this stuff in painful detail, so I&amp;#8217;d love to know where my explanation becomes&amp;nbsp;cloudy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;tl;dr: I wrote a small tool for quantifying alternative junction usage from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RNA&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;STAR&lt;/span&gt; alignment output: https://github.com/olgabot/sj2psi And it&amp;#8217;s on PyPI so you can &lt;code&gt;pip install sj2psi&lt;/code&gt; as&amp;nbsp;well.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Alternative splicing is a method of creating different versions of a gene using the same &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt;. It is awesome because it increases the possible number of genes in say the human genome from just 30,000 to millions. An extreme example is the &lt;em&gt;Drosoephila&lt;/em&gt; (fruit fly) gene &lt;em&gt;Dscam&lt;/em&gt;, which has over 60,000 potential versions, more than the genes in the &lt;em&gt;Drosophila&lt;/em&gt; genome! Alternative splicing happens by combining different &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;exons&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#8221; together (always in linear order) to create different proteins (or other gene products like &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-coding_RNA"&gt;ncRNAs&lt;/a&gt; but we won&amp;#8217;t go into&amp;nbsp;that)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These different versions of the same gene are called &amp;#8220;isoforms.&amp;#8221; What we care about is looking at individual events because we study &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RNA-binding_protein"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RNA&lt;/span&gt; binding proteins&lt;/a&gt; (RBPs), some of which have an effect on alternative splicing when they bind &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RNA&lt;/span&gt;. So maybe we know that an &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RBP&lt;/span&gt; binds some gene&amp;#8217;s &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RNA&lt;/span&gt;, but it (most likely) only has an effect on the exon(s) immediately before or after. For example, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RBP&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOX2&lt;/span&gt; is one of &lt;a href="http://yeolab.ucsd.edu/yeolab/Home.html"&gt;our lab&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; favorites, partly because our boss found that if &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOX2&lt;/span&gt; binds upstream (&amp;#8220;before&amp;#8221; in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt; terms) of an exon, it suppresses inclusion of it. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HOWEVER&lt;/span&gt;! &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FOX2&lt;/span&gt; binding downstream (&amp;#8220;after&amp;#8221;) an exon promotes inclusion! Check out this figure from &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2735254/"&gt;Yeo et al, &lt;em&gt;Nat Struct Mol Bio&lt;/em&gt; (2009)&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="https://31.media.tumblr.com/8749e1c26cb36237e1d8d2ea874327f1/tumblr_inline_n4wpkodHzT1rw6gvj.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Quantifying alternative exon usage and changes is always a challenge, and this is especially difficult for unannotated splicing events. Which is why I was excited when I read &lt;a href="http://genome.cshlp.org/content/early/2013/12/03/gr.161034.113?top=1"&gt;a single-cell paper&lt;/a&gt; learned of &lt;a href="https://github.com/pervouchine/bam2ssj"&gt;&lt;code&gt;bam2ssj&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (Paper: &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23172860"&gt;Pervouchine et al, &lt;em&gt;Bioinformatics&lt;/em&gt; (2013)&lt;/a&gt; and its successor, &lt;a href="https://github.com/pervouchine/sjcount"&gt;&lt;code&gt;sjcount&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. The promise is that instead of quantifying whole splicing events which have to fall into some specific category (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SE&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MXE&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RI&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;A5SS&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;A3SS&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AFE&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALE&lt;/span&gt;/TandemUTR, see this figure from &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v456/n7221/abs/nature07509.html"&gt;Wang &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ET&lt;/span&gt; et al, &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; (2008)&lt;/a&gt;. Each &amp;#8220;box&amp;#8221; is an exon and the lines in between exons are stretches of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt; that are removed (called &amp;#8220;introns&amp;#8221; because they &amp;#8220;interrupt&amp;#8221; the&amp;nbsp;exons)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v456/n7221/images/nature07509-f2.2.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus these events have to be annotated for use with my splicing quantifier of choice (&lt;a href="http://miso.readthedocs.org/en/fastmiso/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MISO&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), or you could try to pull them out from the aligned file. However, I work with single-cell data and since splicing is mostly binary in single cells (i.e. you have mostly isoform A and not both isoform A and B, citation: &lt;a href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23685454"&gt;Shalek et al, &lt;em&gt;Nature&lt;/em&gt; (2013)&lt;/a&gt;), it becomes a pain to make these annotations, because you have to merge &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALL&lt;/span&gt; the files together to create like a terrabyte-sized alignment file (usually a &lt;a href="http://genome.sph.umich.edu/wiki/BAM"&gt;&lt;code&gt;*.bam&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;/a&gt;) and then you are introducing all kinds of craziness because what could have been noise in a few cells gets added up together and becomes&amp;nbsp;signal.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sigh.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I&amp;#8217;d much rather use something that quantifies splicing of all junctions, arbitrarily. But when I tried using &lt;code&gt;sjcount&lt;/code&gt; I couldn&amp;#8217;t figure out what one of the outputs was (like what&amp;#8217;s the difference between a &amp;#8220;splice junction&amp;#8221; and a &amp;#8220;splice boundary?&amp;#8221;). Plus I realized that the &amp;#8220;splice junction counts&amp;#8221; (&lt;code&gt;*.ssj&lt;/code&gt;) file was really similar to the &amp;#8220;&lt;code&gt;SJ.out.tab&lt;/code&gt;&amp;#8221; file created by the &lt;a href="https://code.google.com/p/rna-star/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RNA&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;STAR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;aligner.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;.ssj&lt;/code&gt; files look like (I added the column&amp;nbsp;names):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;chrom   start   stop    strand  overhang    count
chr1    146509  155767  .       20      1
chr1    146509  155767  .       34      1
chr1    146509  155767  .       49      3
chr1    168165  169049  .       10      2
chr1    168165  169049  .       49      3
chr1    694503  700103  .       29      1
chr1    694503  700103  .       41      1
chr1    694503  700103  .       49      1
chr1    894461  894595  .       7       2
chr1    894461  894595  .       9       5
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;overhang&amp;#8221; is the number of base pairs of the sequencing read that overlaps with the upstream exon of the splicing event. The rest of the read is on the downstream exon. In our case, our reads are 100 base pairs (&amp;#8220;100bp&amp;#8221;) so if there&amp;#8217;s 20bp overhanging on one exon, the other 80bp are on the other&amp;nbsp;exon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While &lt;code&gt;SJ.out.tab&lt;/code&gt; files are (again I added column&amp;nbsp;names):&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table border="1" class="dataframe"&gt;\n  &lt;thead&gt;\n    &lt;tr style="text-align: right;"&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;chrom&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;first_bp_intron&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;last_bp_intron&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;strand&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;intron_motif&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;annotated&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;unique_junction_reads&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;multimap_junction_reads&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;max_overhang&lt;/th&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/thead&gt;\n  &lt;tbody&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;0&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt; chr1&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt; 135332&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt; 138297&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt; 1&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GC&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt; False&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt; 0&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt; 1&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt; 38&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;1&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt; chr1&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt; 146510&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt; 155766&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt; 2&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CT&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;  True&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt; 5&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt; 1&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt; 34&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;2&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt; chr1&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt; 156895&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt; 158300&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt; 1&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GC&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt; False&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt; 0&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt; 2&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt; 17&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;3&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt; chr1&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt; 168166&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt; 169048&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt; 2&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CT&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;  True&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt; 5&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt; 3&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt; 46&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n    &lt;tr&gt;\n      &lt;th&gt;4&lt;/th&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt; chr1&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt; 169265&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt; 172556&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt; 2&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CT&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;AC&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt;  True&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt; 0&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt; 2&lt;/td&gt;\n      &lt;td&gt; 13&lt;/td&gt;\n    &lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;/tbody&gt;\n&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The start/stop are off by one here because &lt;code&gt;.ssj&lt;/code&gt;&lt;span class="quo"&gt;&amp;#8216;&lt;/span&gt;s index is from the exon end/exon start, and this is from the intron start/intron end. So the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SJ&lt;/span&gt;.out.tab coordinates are (start from &lt;code&gt;.ssj&lt;/code&gt;+1) and (end from &lt;code&gt;.ssj&lt;/code&gt;-1).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FYI&lt;/span&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;.ssc&lt;/code&gt; files looked&amp;nbsp;like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;chr1    894595  894595  .       8       1
chr1    1228468 1228468 .       1       1
chr1    1228468 1228468 .       3       3
chr1    1228468 1228468 .       5       1
chr1    1228468 1228468 .       6       1
chr1    1228468 1228468 .       7       2

chr1    1228468 1228468 .       27      1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This claims to have the same columns as &lt;code&gt;.ssj&lt;/code&gt; files except instead of start/stop it&amp;#8217;s position/position. I was very confused by how you can have a count at a position. Why does &lt;code&gt;chr1:894595&lt;/code&gt; have one line while &lt;code&gt;chr1:1228468&lt;/code&gt; have a bunch? If you search for &lt;code&gt;894595&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;.ssj&lt;/code&gt; file, you&amp;nbsp;get:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;chr1    894461  894595  .       7       2
chr1    894461  894595  .       9       5
chr1    894461  894595  .       10      2
chr1    894461  894595  .       11      1
chr1    894461  894595  .       12      1
chr1    894461  894595  .       14      1
chr1    894461  894595  .       16      2
chr1    894461  894595  .       19      1
chr1    894461  894595  .       20      1
chr1    894461  894595  .       21      13
chr1    894461  894595  .       22      1
chr1    894461  894595  .       42      2
chr1    894461  894595  .       49      14
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;How did all these counts in the last column (which sum to 46 by my calculation) become &lt;strong&gt;1&lt;/strong&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;.ssc&lt;/code&gt; file? I was pretty&amp;nbsp;lost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ANYWAYS&lt;/span&gt; all of this is a buildup to say that I used Pervouchine et al&amp;#8217;s method of quantifying alternative junctions as asking, when this upstream exon (splicing &lt;em&gt;donor&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;D&lt;/em&gt; in figure below) is used with this downstream exon (splicing &lt;em&gt;acceptor&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; in figure below), how often does that happen relative to all other donors and acceptors? In the figure below, the splicing event of interest is a thick, bold line, joined by a solid arc representing the spliced read. The dotted lines represent that this donor could be spliced to a bunch of different acceptor&amp;nbsp;sites. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Donor with alternative acceptors on left, Acceptor with alternative donors on right" src="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/2/273/F2.medium.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is quantified with a $\Psi_5$ (&amp;#8220;Percent spliced-in&amp;#8221;, or &amp;#8220;Psi&amp;#8221; of the donor, which is at the 5&amp;#8217; end of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RNA&lt;/span&gt;) and $\Psi_3$ (&amp;#8220;Psi&amp;#8221; of the acceptor, located at the 3&amp;#8217; end of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RNA&lt;/span&gt;)&amp;nbsp;scores:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/2/273/embed/graphic-3.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where the summation is over all other possible acceptors (in the case of &lt;em&gt;A&amp;#8217;&lt;/em&gt;) or all other possible donors (in the case of &lt;em&gt;D&amp;#8217;&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So using the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SJ&lt;/span&gt;.out.tab files from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RNA&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;STAR&lt;/span&gt; and the magic of &lt;a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;pandas&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, and a &lt;a href="https://github.com/olgabot/sj2psi/blob/master/sj2psi/__init__.py#L64"&gt;bit of filtering&lt;/a&gt;, you can calculate these scores very&amp;nbsp;easily:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;sj[&amp;#39;psi5&amp;#39;] = sj.groupby([&amp;#39;chrom&amp;#39;, 
    &amp;#39;first_bp_intron&amp;#39;])[&amp;#39;total_filtered_reads&amp;#39;].transform(lambda x: x/x.sum())
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;While this does $\Psi$ scores from raw counts which is frequentist and I prefer to be Bayesian, this is a reasonable&amp;nbsp;start.&lt;/p&gt;

I&amp;#8217;ve run into numerous issues where I prepend my &lt;code&gt;PYTHONPATH&lt;/code&gt; with the directory I want to get imported first, but to no avail. You&amp;#8217;ve run into this: you &lt;code&gt;export PYTHONPATH&lt;/code&gt; exactly as you want, only to see that &lt;code&gt;import sys; sys.path&lt;/code&gt; includes all kinds of other junk before&amp;nbsp;it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, after watching a &lt;a href="http://blip.tv/pycon-us-videos-2009-2010-2011/pycon-2011-reverse-engineering-ian-bicking-s-brain-inside-pip-and-virtualenv-4899496"&gt;talk&lt;/a&gt; about reverse-engineering &lt;code&gt;virtualenv&lt;/code&gt;. I realized I actually don&amp;#8217;t understand anything about what python does at startup. So after a lot of searching, I found out that to load packages, Python reads the &lt;code&gt;site.py&lt;/code&gt; file. I read about &lt;a href="http://docs.python.org/2/library/site.html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;site.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. And I found&amp;nbsp;out&amp;#8230;..&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TURNS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OUT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PYTHON&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SECRETLY&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LOADS&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PACKAGES&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BEFORE&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;LOOKING&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PYTHONPATH&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Shocking!" src="http://media0.giphy.com/media/aCpmM0W4tfG48/giphy.gif"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And where it looks is the &lt;code&gt;*.pth&lt;/code&gt; files found in &lt;code&gt;path/to/python/lib/site-packages/*.pth&lt;/code&gt;. The biggest culprit is usually &lt;code&gt;easy_-nstall.pth&lt;/code&gt;. Mine had all kinds of absolute paths to the bigger Python install that I had to&amp;nbsp;remove.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On my computer, &lt;code&gt;easy-install.pth&lt;/code&gt; looks like&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__plen&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;./&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pytz&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;2013.8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;py2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;7.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;egg&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__plen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:];&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;del&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__plen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:];&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;getattr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;__egginsert&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__egginsert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;So let&amp;#8217;s say I never wanted to use my development versions of something, then I&amp;#8217;d remove that line from the file. Although eventually this got so much of a problem in my &lt;code&gt;virtualenv&lt;/code&gt; at work that at I added the &lt;code&gt;site-packages&lt;/code&gt; directory of that python distribution indirectly with &lt;code&gt;./&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__plen&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;./&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;./&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;distribute&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;0.6&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;py2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;7.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;egg&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;home&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;obotvinnik&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;workspace&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;git&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gscripts&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__plen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:];&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="k"&gt;del&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__plen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:];&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;getattr&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;__egginsert&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;path&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;sys&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;__egginsert&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;+&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;len&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;new&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

I&amp;#8217;ve tried to convince them to pursue programming, not just because it&amp;#8217;ll make their research analyses faster and better, but because it&amp;#8217;s an incredibly powerful skill that anyone can&amp;nbsp;learn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I see programming and engineering as just other methods of creating things that never were, like writing or art or music or dance. Before &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper"&gt;Grace Hopper&lt;/a&gt;, there were no compilers for computers, and everything had to be written in machine- and architecture-specific instructions. Before &lt;a href="http://www-cs-faculty.stanford.edu/~knuth/"&gt;Donald Knuth&lt;/a&gt; (also see his &lt;a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=75Ju0eM5T2c"&gt;advice for young people video&lt;/a&gt;), typesetting math equations was a huge pain, and now we have &lt;a href="http://www.tug.org/texlive/"&gt;TeX&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LaTeX"&gt;LaTeX&lt;/a&gt; and derivatives to painlessly create beautiful equations. Before &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds"&gt;Linus Torvalds&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_stallman"&gt;Richard Stallman&lt;/a&gt;, creators of &lt;a href="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/linux-and-gnu.html"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GNU&lt;/span&gt;/Linux&lt;/a&gt; (this is the operating systema upon which Mac &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; is built), there was no unifying operating system that could be modified and changed for each user&amp;#8217;s needs. Before Microsoft and Apple computer, the concept of the personal computer didn&amp;#8217;t even exist, and it was thought to be just a fad that wouldn&amp;#8217;t&amp;nbsp;hold.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reason I got into programming wasn&amp;#8217;t to make games or to hack into things. I started because I was working in a biology lab on protein binding microarrays, and I ran a graduate student&amp;#8217;s code which turned this glass slide with polka dots of where proteins bound to double-stranded &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt;, into the information of the letters bound by this protein. Then, I took my first programming class in my sophomore year of college, and I only took it because it was required for Biological Engineering. It was in &lt;a href="http://www.python.org/"&gt;Python&lt;/a&gt;. I thought it was pretty cool, but the moment where I truly became a computational biologist was my second research experience where I coded up &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/nbt/journal/v22/n10/full/nbt1004-1315.html"&gt;Hidden Markov Models&lt;/a&gt; in Python. The lab I was working in was a C-language lab so I decided to learn C and &amp;#8220;translate&amp;#8221; my program from Python to C. It was awesome. As much as &lt;code&gt;malloc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;free&lt;/code&gt; were annoying (though &lt;code&gt;valgrind&lt;/code&gt; helped!), it was so satisfying to see my program run 100x faster in C, and have the satisfaction that I learned this difficult language. Keep in mind that I had been coding for less than a year when I attempted this&amp;nbsp;project.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I did my &lt;a href="http://bme.soe.ucsc.edu/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MS&lt;/span&gt; in bioinformatics&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://www.ucsc.edu/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UC&lt;/span&gt;-Santa Cruz&lt;/a&gt;, I met Paola. She had studied biochemistry at &lt;a href="http://www.ucla.edu/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UCLA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and came to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UCSC&lt;/span&gt; for the program&amp;#8217;s bimolecular side, since it technically was &lt;em&gt;biomolecular engineering and&lt;/em&gt; bioinformatics. The first class we took for the program was a bioinformatics algorithms course, and this was the first time she had coded in her life. And she did &lt;em&gt;awesome.&lt;/em&gt; She fell in love with coding as I had, and left gel electrophoresis behind to take discrete math courses to boost her &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CS&lt;/span&gt; knowledge. She now works as an engineer at &lt;a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com/"&gt;Survey Monkey&lt;/a&gt;, getting hired after just over a year of&amp;nbsp;coding. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another friend of mine, &lt;a href="http://www.nehalita.com/"&gt;Neha&lt;/a&gt; studied mechanical engineering in undergrad, went into consulting, but hated it. She applied to &lt;a href="https://www.hackerschool.com/"&gt;Hacker School&lt;/a&gt; twice &lt;a href="http://nerdneha.tumblr.com/post/48064403230/try-try-again-a-lesson-in-persistence"&gt;but didn&amp;#8217;t get in&lt;/a&gt;. She took &lt;a href="https://www.udacity.com/"&gt;Udacity&lt;/a&gt; classes on programming and applied again, this time getting in. Through three months of intensive programming and software development at Hacker School, Neha learned more than many people learn in years. She quickly found a job as a software engineer at &lt;a href="http://www.renttherunway.com/rtr_home"&gt;Rent the Runway&lt;/a&gt; and adores&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m incredibly proud of Paola and Neha for reinventing themselves. And the task of learning programming is not impossible, it just takes time and &lt;a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/tedtalks/angela-lee-duckworth-tedtalk_b_4277459.html"&gt;grit&lt;/a&gt;. And you can do it,&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next time you sit down to analyze some differential expression or calculate some statistics, force yourself to do it in Python, specifically &lt;a href="http://pandas.pydata.org"&gt;pandas&lt;/a&gt;. Feel free to tweet at me with questions! My handle is &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/olgabot"&gt;@olgabot&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EDIT&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I forgot to mention that one of my mentors, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sean_Eddy"&gt;Sean Eddy&lt;/a&gt;, studied molecular biology for his PhD, and only after he earned his PhD did he get into coding. And he&amp;#8217;s made significant contributions to the field of computational biology through the sequence homology comparison program, &lt;a href="http://hmmer.janelia.org/"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;HMMER&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RNA&lt;/span&gt; structure prediction through &lt;a href="http://infernal.janelia.org/"&gt;Infernal&lt;/a&gt;. If you can do it after a PhD, it&amp;#8217;s truly never too&amp;nbsp;late!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On the flip side, at both &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UC&lt;/span&gt;-Santa Cruz and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UC&lt;/span&gt;-San Diego there are lifelong software engineers who have spent decades coding up programs, and have decided that they want to apply their programming skills to something else. So they go do a PhD in bioinformatics! Either way, from biology to coding, or from coding to biology, you end up in bioinformatics! Clearly the best field&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Resources for learning to&amp;nbsp;code&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.codecademy.com/"&gt;Codecademy&lt;/a&gt; (like a &amp;#8220;code-academy&amp;#8221;&amp;#8230; get it??): Codecademy is an awesome resource for getting started with a language. I used it to learn&amp;nbsp;Javascript!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://rosalind.info/problems/locations/"&gt;Rosalind.info&lt;/a&gt;: Named after Rosalind Franklin, whose X-ray crystallography experiments helped Watson and Crick discover that &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt; is a double helix, Rosalind.info is an awesome resource for bioinformatics-specific problems. You start with translating &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt; to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RNA&lt;/span&gt; to Protein, then eventually you build your own genome&amp;nbsp;assembler!&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1"&gt;try.github.io&lt;/a&gt;: Cool way to start learning code versioning (keeping backups of your code), which is ultra-important so you don&amp;#8217;t have to try to remember what you did six months&amp;nbsp;ago.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.coursera.org/"&gt;Coursera&lt;/a&gt;: An online learning platform with tons of classes, including the awesome (Bioinformatics Algorithms)[https://www.coursera.org/course/bioinformatics] class that I helped design. I&amp;#8217;ve also taken the &lt;a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/pgm"&gt;Probabalistic Graphical Models&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://www.coursera.org/course/ml"&gt;Machine Learning&lt;/a&gt; courses. PGMs was good, but &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ML&lt;/span&gt; was a little watered down for my math major self, but it&amp;#8217;s a good intro&amp;nbsp;overall.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.udacity.com/"&gt;Udacity&lt;/a&gt;: Another online learning platform. They have tons of courses on &lt;a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs101"&gt;Computer Science&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs253"&gt;Web Development&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/cs212"&gt;Design of Computer Programs&lt;/a&gt; (taught by &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Norvig"&gt;Peter Norvig&lt;/a&gt;!!!), and many, many,&amp;nbsp;more.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But python&amp;#8217;s &lt;code&gt;zip&lt;/code&gt; is smart in that it stops when the shortest item in the zip&amp;nbsp;stops!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So you can&amp;nbsp;do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;for i, thing in zip(range(5), things):
    print thing
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And it will only show you the first 5 things! And it&amp;#8217;s so succinct! This is especially pertinent when your &lt;code&gt;things&lt;/code&gt; is a generator and you can&amp;#8217;t necessarily get the &lt;code&gt;len&lt;/code&gt; of&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;

Consider a single dancer in a 1.5 hour performance. A professional 25-year-old dancer has probably been dancing since they were around 5, and they&amp;#8217;ve logged thousands of hours practicing dance, and probably another few hundred preparing for this single performance. Before they learned the dance, the choreographer, who has also probably been dancing for the same amount of time, but has spent significant amount practicing coming up with new choreography, spent tens if not hundreds of hours coming with the choreography to be taught for this&amp;nbsp;performance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Same with scientists - hours of work and preparation go into just the technical aspects of a manuscript, grant, or technical presentation, and even more time goes into editing, wordsmithing, and perfecting the delivery. But here the performance is the text, which must stand alone for all eternity as the written manifestation of this&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Why do we spend so much time before the actual performance? Because it&amp;#8217;s only the performance that people see and remember. If they see an uninspired performance of dull choreography, they&amp;#8217;ll remember that and not want to see that show/dancers/choreographer again. If they see a crappy paper, they&amp;#8217;ll remember the authors and know not to take their work too seriously in the future.

Well, I got tired of tweaking every single figure individually so I wrote this library, &lt;a href="http://olgabot.github.io/prettyplotlib"&gt;&lt;code&gt;prettyplotlib&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to have pretty default plots in Python&amp;#8217;s &lt;code&gt;matplotlib&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I truly believe that poor visualizations obstruct scientific progress, and this is my&amp;nbsp;contribution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A couple motivating examples are below, but if you just want an overview, check out the &lt;a href="https://github.com/olgabot/prettyplotlib/wiki/Comparison-to-matplotlib"&gt;Comparison to matplotlib defaults&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://github.com/olgabot/prettyplotlib/wiki/Gallery"&gt;Examples Gallery&lt;/a&gt;,  and &lt;a href="https://github.com/olgabot/prettyplotlib/wiki/Examples-with-code"&gt;Examples with code&lt;/a&gt; on&amp;nbsp;Github.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To install, do the usual &lt;code&gt;pip install&lt;/code&gt; stuff:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;pip install prettyplotlib
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I truly hope you enjoy using this library! If you have any comments or suggestions, let me&amp;nbsp;know!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;code&gt;prettyplotlib.scatter&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default &lt;code&gt;matplotlib&lt;/code&gt; color cycle is not pretty to look at. What&amp;#8217;s even worse is
that if you just do a &lt;code&gt;scatter&lt;/code&gt; plot, then it doesn&amp;#8217;t cycle at all through any&amp;nbsp;values&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;matplotlib.pyplot&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;plt&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Before &lt;code&gt;prettyplotlib&lt;/code&gt;: how to make nice&amp;nbsp;plots&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now I&amp;#8217;m going to take you through &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALL&lt;/span&gt; the steps I used to take to make nice
looking&amp;nbsp;plots.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;First, change the colors with &lt;code&gt;brewer2mpl&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;# Get &amp;quot;Set2&amp;quot; colors from ColorBrewer (all colorbrewer scales: http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/5577023)
set2 = brewer2mpl.get_map(&amp;#39;Set2&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;qualitative&amp;#39;, 8).mpl_colors
...
color = set2[i]
ax.scatter(x, y, label=str(i), facecolor=color)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The full code&amp;nbsp;is,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;matplotlib.pyplot&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;plt&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;brewer2mpl&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Get &amp;quot;Set2&amp;quot; colors from ColorBrewer (all colorbrewer scales: http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/5577023)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;set2&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;brewer2mpl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;get_map&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Set2&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;qualitative&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mpl_colors&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Set the random seed for consistency&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;seed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;fig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ax&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;plt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;subplots&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Show the whole color range&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;normal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;loc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;normal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;loc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;set2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;ax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;scatter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;color&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;fig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;savefig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;scatter_matplotlib_improved_01_changed_colors.png&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This looks nice, almost like an impressionist painting, but it&amp;#8217;s still hard to
see overlaps here. So let&amp;#8217;s fill the symbols with &lt;code&gt;0.5&lt;/code&gt; opacity using
&lt;code&gt;alpha=0.5&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;ax.scatter(x, y, label=str(i), color=color, alpha=0.5)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The full code&amp;nbsp;is,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;matplotlib.pyplot&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;plt&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is still pretty lovely and impressionist-y but I still didn&amp;#8217;t like that it
was hard to see when the dots overlapped. So let&amp;#8217;s add a black outline, and
specify that &lt;code&gt;color&lt;/code&gt; is just the &lt;code&gt;facecolor&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;ax.scatter(x, y, label=str(i), alpha=0.5, edgecolor=&amp;#39;black&amp;#39;,

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Now&lt;/em&gt; we&amp;#8217;re getting somewhere. This looks very lovely. Don&amp;#8217;t you want to just
cuddle up with that cute&amp;nbsp;plot?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What are those top and right axes lines really doing for us? They&amp;#8217;re boxing the
data in, but we can do that with our eyes from the other axis lines. So let&amp;#8217;s
remove the top and right axis lines using &lt;code&gt;ax.spines&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;# Remove top and right axes lines (&amp;quot;spines&amp;quot;)
spines_to_remove = [&amp;#39;top&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;right&amp;#39;]

ax.spines[spine].set_visible(False)

&lt;p&gt;Oops, but we still have the ticks on the top and right axes. We&amp;#8217;ll need to get
rid of them. Actually, why don&amp;#8217;t we just get rid of all ticks altogether? We can
tell by the position of the number where it indicates, so we don&amp;#8217;t need an
additional&amp;nbsp;tick.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;# Get rid of ticks. The position of the numbers is informative enough of
# the position of the value.

&lt;p&gt;Ahh, much better. But we won&amp;#8217;t stop there. Now we&amp;#8217;ll tweak the remaining pieces
of the figure. For the rest of the spines, let&amp;#8217;s thin the line down to &lt;code&gt;0.5&lt;/code&gt;
points instead of the default &lt;code&gt;1.0&lt;/code&gt; points. Also, we&amp;#8217;ll change it from pure
black to a slightly lighter dark grey. Here they are side by&amp;nbsp;side:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;fig, axes = plt.subplots(2)
axes[0].set_axis_bgcolor(&amp;#39;black&amp;#39;)
axes[0].text(0.5, 0.5, &amp;#39;black&amp;#39;, color=&amp;#39;white&amp;#39;, fontsize=24, va=&amp;#39;center&amp;#39;, ha=&amp;#39;center&amp;#39;)
axes[1].set_axis_bgcolor(&amp;#39;#262626&amp;#39;)
axes[1].text(0.5, 0.5, &amp;#39;almost black&amp;#39;, fontsize=24, color=&amp;#39;white&amp;#39;, va=&amp;#39;center&amp;#39;, ha=&amp;#39;center&amp;#39;)
fig.savefig(&amp;#39;black_vs_almost_black.png&amp;#39;)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Matplotlib scatter improved 06: removed tick marks" src="https://raw.github.com/olgabot/prettyplotlib/master/ipython_notebooks/black_vs_almost_black.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So not a &lt;em&gt;huge&lt;/em&gt; difference, and the dark grey still looks pretty black, but it&amp;#8217;s
&lt;a href="http://ianstormtaylor.com/design-tip-never-use-black/"&gt;a little more pleasant on the eyes&lt;/a&gt; to use a dark grey instead of black. There&amp;#8217;s very few things in
nature that are truly black. Just look at shadows! They&amp;#8217;re just dark grey, or
blue, or red or purple. But I digress. Back to plotting&amp;nbsp;libraries&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To change the x-axis and y-axis line colors, and the outlines of the scatter
symbols from black to dark grey, we&amp;#8217;ll&amp;nbsp;do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;# For remaining spines, thin out their line and change the black to a slightly off-black dark grey
almost_black = &amp;#39;#262626&amp;#39;
...
ax.scatter(x, y, label=str(i), alpha=0.5, edgecolor=&amp;#39;black&amp;#39;, facecolor=color, linewidth=0.15)`
...
spines_to_keep = [&amp;#39;bottom&amp;#39;, &amp;#39;left&amp;#39;]
for spine in spines_to_keep:
    ax.spines[spine].set_linewidth(0.5)
    ax.spines[spine].set_color(almost_black)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The full code&amp;nbsp;is,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;matplotlib.pyplot&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;plt&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is nice. But if you look closely, the tick labels are still black :(  We
have to change them separately,&amp;nbsp;using&lt;/p&gt;

ax.xaxis.label.set_color(almost_black)

&lt;p&gt;And while we&amp;#8217;re at it, let&amp;#8217;s add a title and make it dark grey&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;# Change the axis title to off-black

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Matplotlib scatter improved 09: added ugly legend" src="https://raw.github.com/olgabot/prettyplotlib/master/ipython_notebooks/scatter_matplotlib_improved_09_ugly_legend.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are many things I don&amp;#8217;t like about this&amp;nbsp;legend.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;First of all, why does it have such a thick border line? What does that
really add to our interpretation of the legend? The black line is so thick that
it distracts from what we&amp;#8217;re trying to portray - which label goes with which&amp;nbsp;color.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Why does it show three points? Does this legend think I&amp;#8217;m dumb and can&amp;#8217;t
figure out which symbol goes with which label after one iteration, so it does it
three&amp;nbsp;times?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Finally, the legend labels are pure black. Maybe you notice it too, after
comparing to x-axis and y-axis lines and&amp;nbsp;labels.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;ll accomplish these three things using this&amp;nbsp;code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;# Remove the line around the legend box, and instead fill it with a light grey
# Also only use one point for the scatterplot legend because the user will
# get the idea after just one, they don&amp;#39;t need three.
light_grey = np.array([float(248)/float(255)]*3)
legend = ax.legend(frameon=True, scatterpoints=1, fontcolor=almost_black)
rect = legend.get_frame()
rect.set_facecolor(light_grey)
rect.set_linewidth(0.0)

# Change the legend label colors to almost black, too
texts = legend.texts
for t in texts:
    t.set_color(almost_black)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now our code is pretty huge&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;matplotlib.pyplot&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;plt&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Get &amp;quot;Set2&amp;quot; colors from ColorBrewer (all colorbrewer scales: http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/5577023)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;ax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;yaxis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;set_ticks_position&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;none&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# For remaining spines, thin out their line and change the black to a slightly off-black dark grey&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;almost_black&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;#262626&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;legend&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;legend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;frameon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;scatterpoints&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Matplotlib scatter improved 10: beautiful legend" src="https://raw.github.com/olgabot/prettyplotlib/master/ipython_notebooks/scatter_matplotlib_improved_10_pretty_legend.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aaaaaaaaaaand I got tired of doing all those steps, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;EVERY&lt;/span&gt; time I wanted to make a simple scatterplot. So I wrote
&lt;a href="http://github.com/olgabot/prettyplotlib"&gt;&lt;code&gt;prettyplotlib&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Here&amp;#8217;s an
illustrative example of how awesome &lt;code&gt;prettyplotlib&lt;/code&gt; is, and how it will save
all the time you spent agonizing over making your &lt;code&gt;matplotlib&lt;/code&gt; plots&amp;nbsp;beautiful.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;prettyplotlib&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;ppl&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;numpy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;fig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ax&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ppl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;subplots&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Set the random seed for consistency&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kp"&gt;seed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Show the whole color range&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;normal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;loc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kp"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;normal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;loc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kp"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;ppl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;scatter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;ppl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;legend&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;ax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;set_title&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;prettyplotlib `scatter` example&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="se"&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;showing default color cycle and scatter params&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;fig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;savefig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;scatter_prettyplotlib_default.png&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Matplotlib scatter improved 10: beautiful legend" src="https://raw.github.com/olgabot/prettyplotlib/master/ipython_notebooks/scatter_prettyplotlib_default.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The only commands that were different from the very first example with
matplotlib&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;ppl.scatter(ax, x, y, label=str(i), facecolor=&amp;#39;none&amp;#39;)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;instead&amp;nbsp;of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;ax.scatter(x, y, label=str(i))
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And a different legend&amp;nbsp;command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;ppl.legend(ax)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;instead&amp;nbsp;of:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;ax.legend()
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If you &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; want to get the original matplotlib style back in
prettyplotlib, you can&amp;nbsp;do:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;prettyplotlib&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;ppl&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Set the random seed for consistency&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;seed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;12&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;fig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ax&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;plt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;subplots&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#mpl.rcParams[&amp;#39;axis.color_cycle&amp;#39;] = [&amp;#39;blue&amp;#39;]&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Show the whole color range&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nb"&gt;range&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;8&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;):&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;normal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;loc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;normal&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;loc&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1000&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;ax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;scatter&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;x&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;y&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;label&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nb"&gt;str&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;),&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;facecolor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;blue&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;edgecolor&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;black&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;linewidth&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;# Get back the top and right axes lines (&amp;quot;spines&amp;quot;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;spines_to_remove&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;top&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;right&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="k"&gt;for&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;spine&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="ow"&gt;in&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;spines_to_remove&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;
    &lt;span class="n"&gt;ax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;spines&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;spine&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;set_visible&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="bp"&gt;True&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Prettyplotlib back to matplotlib" src="https://raw.github.com/olgabot/prettyplotlib/master/ipython_notebooks/scatter_prettyplotlib_back_to_matplotlib_default.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Notice that the default calls of &lt;code&gt;ax.scatter&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ax.legend&lt;/code&gt; do the usual
thing. This is important, because for &lt;code&gt;prettyplotlib&lt;/code&gt; to work, you&amp;#8217;ll need to
use a syntax that&amp;#8217;s different from the usual &lt;code&gt;matplotlib&lt;/code&gt; one:  &lt;code&gt;ppl.scatter(ax,
x, y...)&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;ax.scatter(x, y, ...)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;code&gt;prettyplotlib.pcolormesh&lt;/code&gt;: Improving heatmaps in &lt;code&gt;matplotlib&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Both positive and negative&amp;nbsp;values&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The default &lt;code&gt;matplotlib&lt;/code&gt; &lt;code&gt;pcolormesh&lt;/code&gt; heatmaps use a rainbow colormap, which has
been known to mislead data visualization. Specifically, &lt;a href="http://www.jwave.vt.edu/~rkri
z/Projects/create_color_table/color_07.pdf"&gt;&lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;the rainbow color map
is universally inferior to all other color maps&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Unfortunately, &lt;code&gt;matplotlib&lt;/code&gt; took
its default colors from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MATLAB&lt;/span&gt;, and there the default is also&amp;nbsp;rainbow.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;matplotlib.pyplot&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;plt&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;numpy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;fig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ax&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;plt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;subplots&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kp"&gt;seed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#ax.pcolor(np.random.randn((10,10)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="c1"&gt;#ax.pcolor(np.random.randn(10), np.random.randn(10))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pcolormesh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;randn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;fig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;colorbar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;fig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;savefig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;pcolormesh_matplotlib_default.png&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Matplotlib default scatterplot" src="https://raw.github.com/olgabot/prettyplotlib/master/ipython_notebooks/pcolormesh_matplotlib_default.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Using the same zero-centered randomly distributed gaussian distribution, we can
plot it using &lt;code&gt;prettyplotlib&lt;/code&gt; with a few modifications in&amp;nbsp;syntax:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;ppl.pcolormesh(fig, ax, np.random.randn(10,10))
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ll notice that the &amp;#8220;hot&amp;#8221; (large, positive) color is still red, and the
&amp;#8220;cold&amp;#8221; (small, negative) color is still blue, but the in between colors are
gradations of red and blue, so it&amp;#8217;s easier to tell the difference between&amp;nbsp;values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;prettyplotlib&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;ppl&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;numpy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;fig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ax&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ppl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;subplots&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kp"&gt;seed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;ppl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pcolormesh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;randn&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;fig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;savefig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;pcolormesh_prettyplotlib_default.png&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Matplotlib default scatterplot" src="https://raw.github.com/olgabot/prettyplotlib/master/ipython_notebooks/pcolormesh_prettyplotlib_default.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have also noticed similar changes as were made in &lt;code&gt;prettyplotlib.scatter&lt;/code&gt;,
where axis lines were removed, and blacks were changed to almost&amp;nbsp;black.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Only positive (or negative)&amp;nbsp;values&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your data is only positive (or negative), &lt;code&gt;matplotlib&lt;/code&gt; does nothing to change
the color scale. It&amp;#8217;s still a rainbow, but look at the colorbar, the range is
different (0 to 1 instead of -2 to&amp;nbsp;+2)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;prettyplotlib&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;ppl&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;numpy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;fig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ax&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ppl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;subplots&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;ax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;pcolormesh&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;random&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kp"&gt;uniform&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kp"&gt;size&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;10&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;fig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;colorbar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If your data is only positive or negative, then &lt;code&gt;prettyplotlib&lt;/code&gt; will auto-detect
this and use a single-color colormap. The default for positive data is the
&lt;code&gt;reds&lt;/code&gt; colormap.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;prettyplotlib&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;ppl&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;h2&gt;Add x or y tick&amp;nbsp;labels&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus you can add x- and y-ticklabels&amp;nbsp;directly!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Normally, when you add x- and y-ticklabels on &lt;code&gt;pcolormesh&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;matplotlib&lt;/code&gt;,
they&amp;#8217;re not centered on the blocks, and you have to do a lot of annoying work
just getting a label on each box. You have to specify the xticks explicitly,
since you want to label each&amp;nbsp;box.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;xticks = range(10)
yticks = range(10)

xticklabels=string.uppercase[:10]
yticklabels=string.lowercase[-10:]

ax.set_xticks(xticks)
ax.set_xticklabels(xticklabels)

ax.set_yticks(yticks)
ax.set_yticklabels(yticklabels)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The full, &lt;code&gt;matplotlib&lt;/code&gt; code&amp;nbsp;is:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;prettyplotlib&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;ppl&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;numpy&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;np&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;fig&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;colorbar&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;span class="n"&gt;ax&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;set_yticklabels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;yticklabels&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But &lt;code&gt;prettyplotlib.pcolormesh&lt;/code&gt; assumes that you want the &lt;code&gt;xticklabels&lt;/code&gt; and
&lt;code&gt;yticklabels&lt;/code&gt; on each block, and makes it easy to&amp;nbsp;specify.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;ppl.pcolormesh(fig, ax, np.random.uniform(size=(10,10)),

&lt;h3&gt;Custom&amp;nbsp;colormaps&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Or pick your own colormap! The diverging colormap &lt;code&gt;PRGn&lt;/code&gt; or Purple and Green is
pretty nice. I usually use this website to look up the colormaps: &lt;a href="http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/5577023"&gt;Every
Colorbrewer Scale&lt;/a&gt; (hover over the colors to get the name of the&amp;nbsp;colormap)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3&gt;Log normalization or other&amp;nbsp;parameters&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus, this will take the usual parameters of &lt;code&gt;pcolormesh&lt;/code&gt; like if you want to
rescale your data to&amp;nbsp;log-scale:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;matplotlib.colors&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;LogNorm&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The full &lt;code&gt;prettyplotlib&lt;/code&gt; code&amp;nbsp;is,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That&amp;#8217;s my introduction to &lt;code&gt;prettyplotlib&lt;/code&gt; and why you need it. There are similar
examples for the other functions, but these ones for &lt;code&gt;ppl.scatter&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ppl.pcolormesh&lt;/code&gt; are the most&amp;nbsp;extensive.&lt;/p&gt;</content><category term="python"></category><category term="matplotlib"></category><category term="prettyplotlib"></category><category term="programming"></category><category term="data visualization"></category><category term="dataviz"></category></entry><entry><title>The R script that will change your life</title><link href="/blog/2013/05/03/2013-05-03-the-r-script-that-will-change-your-life/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2013-05-03T10:01:30-07:00</published><updated>2013-05-03T10:01:30-07:00</updated><author><name>sciencemeetproductivity</name></author><id>tag:None,2013-05-03:/blog/2013/05/03/2013-05-03-the-r-script-that-will-change-your-life/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;If you use the &lt;a href="http://www.r-project.org/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; programming language, you probably know how much of a pain it is to keep your packages updated.

You&amp;#8217;ve run &lt;code&gt;update.packages(...)&lt;/code&gt; on the few that you want to keep up to date, but it&amp;#8217;s a pain in the neck to do that for every package, every time. Thankfully, where there&amp;#8217;s a will, there&amp;#8217;s a&amp;nbsp;way!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; starts up, it looks at your &lt;code&gt;.Rprofile&lt;/code&gt; file (if you have one), and runs it. Mine looks like&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;

library(utils)
update.packages(ask = FALSE)
my.packages = c(&amp;quot;CvM2SL2Test&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;MASS&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;verification&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;gtools&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;ROCR&amp;quot;,

if( length(to.download) &amp;gt; 0){
    install.packages(my.packages[to.download], clean=TRUE, dependencies=TRUE)
}
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This script has three awesome&amp;nbsp;features:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It will update &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALL&lt;/span&gt; the packages I have without&amp;nbsp;asking.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It has an A-list of packages that I always want to&amp;nbsp;have.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;It iterates over the A-list and makes sure they&amp;#8217;re&amp;nbsp;updated.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It may be a little redundant, but having a few fail-safes never hurt&amp;nbsp;anyone.&lt;/p&gt;

In applying to fellowships, you should apply to as many as possible because in all likelihood, you will not get one. You need to try as hard as possible to get one, combing over your essays and reading them aloud before you submit, but keep this reality in&amp;nbsp;mind.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year I applied to six (6) graduate fellowships and won one, plus a Finalist for one. Last year I also applied to six (6) and won zero, though got Honorable Mention for one. Below is a table of all the fellowships I&amp;#8217;ve applied to in the past two years, and their results. If the cell is empty, then I did not apply that&amp;nbsp;year. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the spirit of sharing, such as those PIs who have &lt;a href="http://jabberwocky.weecology.org/2012/08/10/a-list-of-publicly-available-grant-proposals-in-the-biological-sciences/"&gt;publicly posted&lt;/a&gt; their funded and unfunded grant proposals, I&amp;#8217;m posting &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ALL&lt;/span&gt; my essays. For each year I applied, I&amp;#8217;ve put all my documents associated with each application so you can read them and compare the successful and unsuccessful essays. Some are rather personal, but that&amp;#8217;s the nature of the essay. Also, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSF&lt;/span&gt; one includes a ratings sheet so you can delve into the mind of the assessors as well. I realize the file sizes are huge but blame Microsoft Word 2011, not&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the table, I&amp;#8217;ll discuss advice for each&amp;nbsp;fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below are the tips I have for each of these fellowships, but keep in mind that I did not win most of&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;DOE&lt;/span&gt; Computational Science Graduate&amp;nbsp;Fellowship&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#8217;t give advice for this one, other than to apply. The first time I around I just talked about science, the second year I emphasized how my research needs lots of awesome computers but none of those strategies seemed to work. Those people also require a course plan, so maybe they though mine wasn&amp;#8217;t serious enough. No&amp;nbsp;clue.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Honestly I thought I had a pretty good shot at this, since I got to the Finalist stage for the Hertz Fellowship, but it goes to show you that each of these fellowship associations have subtly different&amp;nbsp;standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Ford Foundation Predoctoral&amp;nbsp;Fellowship&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This fellowship is aimed at those who are going to increase diversity in the professoriate, whether by being a minority themselves, or by participating in programs that encourage minorities to pursue research and academia. I applied as a member of the latter&amp;nbsp;group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have to admit my mistake on this one. My undergrad can submit transcripts electronically, and I didn&amp;#8217;t check with them to see if they accepted e-transcripts. I got an email in February saying my application was incomplete, which sent me into a panic and I logged on to the transcripts website and overnighted a transcript to their office. But then I read the email again and saw that they &amp;#8220;encourage you to apply and wish you continued success in all of your academic endeavors.&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;:(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Conclusion: &lt;strong&gt;check with the fellowship organization about their accepted transcript formats and whether they have received all your&amp;nbsp;materials&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Hertz Foundation&amp;nbsp;Fellowship&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is definitely one of the most prestigious fellowships. The first year I applied to this, I was not very scientifically mature, which you can see from my application. But in my 2012-2013 application, I had a vivid idea of what I would like to see in the future of science, and how we were going to get&amp;nbsp;there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are very few resources (save for &lt;a href="http://www.pgbovine.net/fellowship-tips.htm"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://chemgradschool.blogspot.com/2009/02/shortly-after-submitting-my-application.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://djstrouse.com/guide-to-applying-to-us-science-phd-programs-and-fellowships/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;) for the Hertz so I&amp;#8217;ll detail my journey&amp;nbsp;below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Note that the filename of the fellowship document is &lt;code&gt;Olga.Botvinnik_Hertz_2012-2013_v6.pdf&lt;/code&gt;. I did, indeed go through six&amp;nbsp;versions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The&amp;nbsp;Interviews&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Round 1&amp;nbsp;Interview&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Nov. 16 2012, I received an email indicating I had been selected for a first-round interview! Last year, I received the rejection notice on Nov. 11 2012. Given that their due date is usually Nov 1st, it was nice to at least get a quick turnaround. An excerpt from the &amp;#8220;Reject&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;email:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for your application to the Hertz Foundation Fellowship Program for graduate study in the applied sciences.  We greatly appreciate your interest in the Hertz Foundation Fellowship Program and we strongly encourage your continuing contributions to science and&amp;nbsp;technology.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We received over 600 applications this year and were able to choose only about 25% of those for personal interviews.  Unfortunately, we were not able to select you for an interview and therefore, you will not be part of the next round of our selection process.  We regret to inform you of this fact, particularly since the Foundation values the pursuit of applied science and engineering of creative young PhD candidates like&amp;nbsp;yourself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your application was given serious consideration.  In addition to scholastic excellence, there are many other factors associated with the objectives of the Hertz Foundation that we take into account when selecting candidates for interviews.  Our decision was based on the total&amp;nbsp;assessment.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you for choosing a career in science and technology.  We are sure your efforts will make a difference in the&amp;nbsp;world.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I asked for feedback, especially because one of my recommenders didn&amp;#8217;t submit their letter on time, but they said they do not reconsider applications and provided this note from the president of the foundation about the decision&amp;nbsp;process:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We do not provide feedback on individual applications.   In our process, two reviewers read each application.  They look for not just academic excellence, but creativity, early demonstration of research capabilities, motivation and confidence, and the strong endorsement of those traits by referees.  We also look for leverage in the use of our resources.  If you are already well along in graduate school, we question what our contribution to an established research program may&amp;nbsp;bring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you were not selected for an interview, it does not mean that there was any defect in your application or that it was not considered and appreciated.  We rarely see an applicant that we would not choose to fund were resources available.   Like Rhodes, Marshall and Churchill, our success ratio is slightly under 3%.  Unlike them, we invest heavily in sequential one-on-one interviews that depend on the volunteer effort of many excellent scientists and engineers.  We must make a hard selection early on to optimize the use of these&amp;nbsp;resources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the &amp;#8220;Interview&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;email:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Congratulations! You have been chosen to advance to the interview stage of Hertz Fellowship selection process - as one of slightly more than 20% of this year&amp;#8217;s applicants. This involves a formal technical interview with one or more of our interviewers - who are in most cases former Hertz Fellows, themselves. This interview generally lasts 45 to 60 minutes. It is patterned after the PhD oral exam and you may be asked to perform calculations, discuss your previous research work, and to demonstrate the breadth and depth of your technical knowledge. Please bring paper and pen in the event you&amp;#8217;re asked to perform calculations during your&amp;nbsp;interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have new scientific papers that were not submitted with your application, please bring 2 copies for your interviewer. The materials will then be added to your file before it is reviewed for consideration for a second&amp;nbsp;interview.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The interview itself in Los Angeles on Jan 26th 2013, and I carpooled there from San Diego with a couple other people at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UCSD&lt;/span&gt; who also were invited to interview. I dressed in a suit, since they said it will be a &lt;em&gt;formal&lt;/em&gt; interview, and I was crazy nervous. But once I got into the room and started chatting with these crazy smart people, it wasn&amp;#8217;t that bad. It just felt like a conversation about science. They asked me random questions like about how does Purell work and why it&amp;#8217;s preferred over hand washing, about hydrogen bonding in glass, and some statistical questions. I had a really good time talking to them! I think being relaxed and taking my time with answering their questions made a huge&amp;nbsp;difference.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h4&gt;Round 2&amp;nbsp;Interview&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On Feb 1st 2013, I received an email notifying me of my Finalist status. Here&amp;#8217;s some of the&amp;nbsp;email.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are pleased to notify you that you have been designated a Hertz Fellowship Finalist - one of 50 selected from a pool of over 700 very talented&amp;nbsp;applicants. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was so excited! The day that I found out was the first day of my lab&amp;#8217;s ski/snowboard retreat at &lt;a href="http://www.bigbear.com/"&gt;Big Bear Lake/Mountain&lt;/a&gt;, and we were driving up. I was refreshing my email on my phone constantly until I found out at&amp;nbsp;11:55am.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used Zimride/Craigslist rideshares to get there (I&amp;#8217;m having car troubles which is why I&amp;#8217;m avoiding driving it long distances). I was a lot more nervous for this one, and I think it showed. They asked me to explain how I &amp;#8220;got here,&amp;#8221; as in what was my journey in science. The questions where I really faltered were about where I have applied my own creativity in research, and some of the physics/stats questions. Though they were impressed that I had applied two years in a row, and pleased that I completely changed my application, because I guess they get people who submit the same thing. Which doesn&amp;#8217;t make sense to me because if it didn&amp;#8217;t work the year before, it probably won&amp;#8217;t work&amp;nbsp;now&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As they probed me about where I applied my creativity in research, at first I asked if I could talk about a teaching experience because I&amp;#8217;ve taken creative approaches to presenting material. But they said no they weren&amp;#8217;t really interested because after all it wasn&amp;#8217;t like I invented inquiry-based learning (!). So then I racked my brain for where I have done something original in my research, and it dawned on me that most of my research has been following someone else&amp;#8217;s instructions. I&amp;#8217;ve been creative in the implementation of these instructions and coded up nice solutions, but I haven&amp;#8217;t been the originator of the idea. They said &amp;#8220;Impress us. This is where we want you to show off your accomplishments.&amp;#8221; And.. I&amp;nbsp;didn&amp;#8217;t. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the interview I realized that in my Bioinformatics Algorithms class I formulated a really interesting biological problem as a solid computational problem, and this had never been though of before. So emailed that to them, but maybe it came off as too desperate, or not good enough in the face of the accomplishments of my peers. So in any case, I was in the process of doing something really&amp;nbsp;creative.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another question they asked was about where I saw the frontier of science being in the future, and I said &amp;#8220;non-destructive single cell genomics.&amp;#8221; And they they said &amp;#8220;Great! So how would you do that?&amp;#8221; And I had to invent all kinds of technologies to accomplish this wacky future, on the spot. That was pretty&amp;nbsp;draining.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the stats questions, I should have got them because they were simple binomial distribution and heat diffusion through spherical volumes problems, but my brain was so dead from feeling inadequate about my lack of creativity, that I took a really long time to answer them, and then I didn&amp;#8217;t even get them in the&amp;nbsp;end.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Tips from a Hertz Fellow (not&amp;nbsp;me)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Practice some scenarios of questions they may ask of your past research, or a general &amp;#8220;tell me about yourself&amp;#8221; question. This will help you be less&amp;nbsp;nervous&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Study the publications of your interviewers and try to find something in common. These are people with PhDs who are curious about the world, so it&amp;#8217;s better to get them thinking about your topic than for them to sit and come up with  &lt;em&gt;&amp;#8220;What can we ask that s/he probably doesn&amp;#8217;t know?&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;-type questions, which are no&amp;nbsp;fun.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Christian for the&amp;nbsp;tips!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Conclusions on Hertz&amp;nbsp;Fellowship&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need a strong vision for the future of science, supported by your current&amp;nbsp;research.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;You need to have demonstrated creativity in your field by suggesting a new solution, approach, or technique that people go &amp;#8220;wow, why didn&amp;#8217;t I think of that before?&amp;#8221; Simply following instructions to perform other&amp;#8217;s research is not&amp;nbsp;enough.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be quick on your feet with statistics, physics and differential&amp;nbsp;equations.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;National Defense Science and Engineering Graduate (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDSEG&lt;/span&gt;)&amp;nbsp;Fellowship&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Last year I adapted my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSF&lt;/span&gt; fellowship for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDSEG&lt;/span&gt;. The &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDSEG&lt;/span&gt; is more competitive, with ~200 awards out of ~3000 applicants (~6.7%, whereas the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSF&lt;/span&gt; is ~2k awards out of 20k applicants, 10%). While by stats the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDSEG&lt;/span&gt; is more &amp;#8220;prestigious,&amp;#8221; it is not as well-known. I&amp;#8217;m not quite sure what makes a proposal for the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDSEG&lt;/span&gt; good, other than similar criteria to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSF&lt;/span&gt;, so I suggest comparing my successful and unsuccessful fellowship applications. I&amp;#8217;ve heard that you should describe potential military applications of your research in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDSEG&lt;/span&gt; applications, but I didn&amp;#8217;t do that so&amp;#8230; who&amp;nbsp;knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Others have informed me that the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NDSEG&lt;/span&gt; seems to go after recent accomplishments such as publications, whereas the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSF&lt;/span&gt; is more about your potential for future research. Thanks to Reid for the&amp;nbsp;tip!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;National Physical Science&amp;nbsp;Consortium&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This seems like a relatively unknown fellowship because I discovered it randomly. They also have a terrible website where you generate a key instead of a login, and then the key can change&amp;#8230; I had to use 3 different keys for this application. And they basically say to use your &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSF&lt;/span&gt; essays for this application, which is why the header in the file is &amp;#8220;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NPSC&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSF&lt;/span&gt;-Style.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As for advice, no idea on this one &amp;#8230; they still haven&amp;#8217;t gotten back to me (?!), even after I emailed them. So I&amp;#8217;m guessing this is a&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;No.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship Program (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSF&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GFRP&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In case you&amp;#8217;re wondering, I didn&amp;#8217;t apply to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSF&lt;/span&gt; 2012-2013 because I have a Master&amp;#8217;s degree, which makes the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSF&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GRFP&lt;/span&gt; hate&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As the most well known of these fellowships, there are &lt;a href="http://www.alexhunterlang.com/nsf-fellowship"&gt;many&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.pgbovine.net/fellowship-tips.htm"&gt;fantastic&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.jenniferwang.org/nsf.html"&gt;resources&lt;/a&gt; for applying to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSF&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GFRP&lt;/span&gt; (even more &lt;a href="http://www.profellow.com/tag/nsf-grfp/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://secondcriterion.wordpress.com/2012/10/25/four-tips-on-applying-for-the-nsf-grfp/"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://biology.nd.edu/assets/31033/nsf_grf_tips_for_compiling_an_application.pdf"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href="http://www.psychologicalscience.org/index.php/publications/observer/2012/september-12/ten-tips-for-applying-to-the-nsf-graduate-research-fellowship-program.html"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;), so I will just give some general&amp;nbsp;advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Research Proposal&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Speak fluently about your topic. Sound like you actually know what you are doing. This will come when you have many people read your fellowship app and ask questions about the details. The actual topic doesn&amp;#8217;t matter, but you need to convey that you are competent in your&amp;nbsp;field.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;/strong&gt;: Your research should be benefitting the scientific community as a whole, whether you are depositing data publicly, contributing to open-source software, or training new people in&amp;nbsp;science.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Personal Statement&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;/strong&gt;: Make sure you are doing some kind of outreach, either as a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TA&lt;/span&gt; or a volunteer or something. And don&amp;#8217;t just do it for the fellowship because that&amp;#8217;s pretty obvious &amp;#8230; You should have a history of&amp;nbsp;outreach.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tell the story of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WHO&lt;/span&gt; is going to be doing this research. Grad fellowships fund people, not&amp;nbsp;projects.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Previous Research&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you feel &amp;#8220;inadequate&amp;#8221; because you didn&amp;#8217;t do research in undergrad but had classes instead, talk about a class that opened your mind beyond the traditional curriculum and into the unanswered questions of&amp;nbsp;research.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Again, speak fluently about your&amp;nbsp;topic.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Broader Impacts&lt;/strong&gt;: How have your research experiences benefitted the scientific community, either at large, or a few people? Talk about&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Alex for emphasizing Broader&amp;nbsp;Impacts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Outside of those three, the &amp;#8220;topic&amp;#8221; that you apply to is very important, as that determines who reads your application. In Bioinformatics, we&amp;#8217;re in a bit of a no-man&amp;#8217;s land since if we apply to Computer Science then they won&amp;#8217;t understand the biology and say our algorithm is crap, and if we apply to Biology, then they&amp;#8217;ll say we don&amp;#8217;t understand the biology, and gloss over the computational details. So you have to find a delicate&amp;nbsp;balance.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Update&lt;/strong&gt;: Finally, the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSF&lt;/span&gt; is the &lt;strong&gt;only&lt;/strong&gt; fellowship of these 8 (!) to give feedback, so if you only apply to one thing, apply to the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSF&lt;/span&gt; to get a feel for the process, and to receive feedback on your first application. Then in your next application, you will know what&amp;#8217;s going on and can embark on a more serious application. Thanks to Reid for pointing this&amp;nbsp;out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Paul and Daisy Soros Fellowship for New&amp;nbsp;Americans&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The PDSoros Fellowship is very difficult to get, and prestigious. It is for immigrants and children of immigrants (I was born in Russia so I count as an immigrant). Like the Hertz Fellowship, they ask you to focus on times when you have applied creativity in your field, and since I&amp;#8217;ve had that realization with the Hertz, they probably also saw that I haven&amp;#8217;t been that creative. Unlike the Hertz, it is for people pursuing &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ANY&lt;/span&gt; graduate degree, so you are competing with people in law school, medical school, PhD programs, M.A., &lt;span class="caps"&gt;M.F.&lt;/span&gt;A., &lt;span class="caps"&gt;M.P.&lt;/span&gt;H., M.S., M.Eng., etc programs. So it is a very large&amp;nbsp;pool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Plus I didn&amp;#8217;t proofread my essays enough. I looked through them later and saw typos and notes to myself, which is not&amp;nbsp;professional.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Science, Mathematics, and Research for Transformation&amp;nbsp;Scholarship&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No idea. Didn&amp;#8217;t get any feedback about the first time, only this&amp;nbsp;email:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This message is to inform you that you were not chosen as one of the 130 Round 1 Finalists for this year&amp;#8217;s award competition. Please note, a second round of up to 20 additional awards may be issued this month. Your application may be reconsidered for an award at that time. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ASEE&lt;/span&gt; will keep you apprised of your status as new information becomes available. We appreciate your interest in the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SMART&lt;/span&gt; Scholarship&amp;nbsp;Program.&lt;/p&gt;

If you&amp;#8217;re not sure about the origins of your meat, you could sequence it to check for pathogens, the biodiversity of the cows it came from, and its environment to make sure it was truly grass-fed. When you get your hair dyed or permed, you&amp;#8217;ll also get a scalp treatment which changes the genetics of your hair so it conforms to whatever change you&amp;#8217;re getting. Bioterrorism officials will be able to detect virulent threats at the most minuscule&amp;nbsp;amount.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;All this sounds very science-fiction, but I believe we are hurtling towards an exciting future in which biology will play an unprecedented role, due to the current research in single-cell&amp;nbsp;genomics.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Single cell genomics is an exploding field right now, due to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt; amplification techniques introduced in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_displacement_amplification"&gt;2001&lt;/a&gt; improved upon in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MALBAC"&gt;2012&lt;/a&gt;, and novel &lt;a href="http://www.nanoporetech.com/"&gt;single-molecule sequencing methods&lt;/a&gt; which require no amplification at all. For most high-throughput sequencing, the genome-wide sequencing you may have heard about through large efforts such as the &lt;a href="http://www.personalgenomes.org/"&gt;Personal Genome Project&lt;/a&gt;, the &lt;a href="http://www.genome.gov/10005107"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;ENCODE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; project, or &lt;a href="http://cancergenome.nih.gov/"&gt;The Cancer Genome Atlas&lt;/a&gt;, you need a large amount of genetic starting material. This means that to get any usable results, you need to take a large population of cells (~100,000), grind them up, make thousands of copies of the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt;, then send the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt; for&amp;nbsp;sequencing.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right now we are treating tissues as if they are an entire country like the United States, making stereotypes about everyone that lives here based off a few interactions. But the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;US&lt;/span&gt; is composed of &lt;em&gt;people&lt;/em&gt;, individuals who work hard and make tough decisions every day. We simply cannot assume everyone is exactly the&amp;nbsp;same.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The advent of single-cell genomics completely changes this paradigm that we need thousands of cells to understand biology. Instead of treating a heterogenous soup of cells such as a tissue as a homogenous population, for example, assuming every cell in the heart or liver or kidney or cancer tumor is exactly the same (which we know from physiology to be completely false), we can study individual cells and their solo&amp;nbsp;struggles. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From single-cell research, we can finally study tiny amounts of cells. And soon, technology will be good enough that individuals can afford their own sequencers. The &lt;a href="http://www.illumina.com/systems/miseq.ilmn"&gt;Illumina MiSeq&lt;/a&gt; is the closest thing we have right now, but it&amp;#8217;s still too expensive and the bioinformatics isn&amp;#8217;t developed enough for a &lt;em&gt;blood sample &amp;#8212;&amp;gt; ??? &amp;#8212;&amp;gt; profit!&lt;/em&gt;-type experience. In the future, we can sequence individual cells in your blood to predict your current viral load, a key component of health in someone living with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;HIV&lt;/span&gt;. You&amp;#8217;ll be able to perform your own quality control of the food in your home, even checking which farm those &amp;#8220;heirloom&amp;#8221; tomatoes came from, or using an advanced protocol to check for environmental effects (pesticides, soil quality, etc) via epigenetics such as &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bisulfite_sequencing"&gt;bisulfite methylation sequencing of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;DNA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Histone#Functions_of_histone_modifications"&gt;histone modifications&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2012/05/120517131655.htm"&gt;methylated &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RNA&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; (high-throughput methods not yet invented!). When you get your hair treated, you&amp;#8217;ll provide your genome sequence and the hair technician will match your desired hair genes with your current genes, and use that to create a &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_therapy"&gt;gene therapy&lt;/a&gt; so that you don&amp;#8217;t have to come in for root touch-ups - your roots will already be the correct color or level of curliness! Finally, we&amp;#8217;ll be able to detect any smidgen of genetic material lying around, and halt any bioterrorism threat in its&amp;nbsp;tracks.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In one of my classes, the main project is to formulate a biological problem as a computational problem. This formulation should be such that you can give your computational problem formulation to a &amp;#8220;genius computer science slave&amp;#8221; (aka you are the slave, and hopefully the genius will come) and they could come up with an algorithm to solve&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m really excited about my problem formulation, which is a new method of sequence assembly, but every time I met with the professor to discuss my formulation, he wanted me to further simplify the problem. At first, I was too hung up on the quality of the sequencing reads, the fact that they are paired-end, etc. My professor prodded me towards a simpler and simpler formulation, the &amp;#8220;essence of the problem.&amp;#8221; And at this essence of the problem, the solution becomes&amp;nbsp;obvious.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This reminds me of my &lt;a href="http://blog.olgabotvinnik.com/post/30674921280/how-to-be-fabulously-successful-eric-lander"&gt;post about Eric Lander&lt;/a&gt;, where he talked about &amp;#8220;struggling with a problem&amp;#8221; in his interview, and that at some point in the struggle, &amp;#8220;the structure of the problem becomes clear, and the path through it becomes clear.&amp;#8221; I couldn&amp;#8217;t have figured out the essence of the problem without the struggle I went&amp;nbsp;through.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similarly, I see the &amp;#8220;essence&amp;#8221; of cello playing as playing these notes, in this order. I know this is a gross oversimplification, but this what &lt;a href="http://www.celloloft.com/"&gt;my cello teacher&lt;/a&gt; prescribes as the first step in learning a new piece. And I agree with him - if you&amp;#8217;re not comfortable playing these notes in this order, no amount of musicality or phrasing will save you. Once you have these notes down, you can then add bowings, rhythm, phrasing, etc to create a beautiful piece. Maybe the phrasing and performance just falls into place because of the order and rhythm of the notes. But you had to start at the essence&amp;nbsp;first.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>The second article</title><link href="/blog/2012/12/01/the-second-article/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-12-01T10:02:00-08:00</published><updated>2012-12-01T10:02:00-08:00</updated><author><name>Olga Botvinnik</name></author><id>tag:None,2012-12-01:/blog/2012/12/01/the-second-article/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;See below intra-site link examples in Markdown&amp;nbsp;format.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><content type="html">&lt;p&gt;See below intra-site link examples in Markdown&amp;nbsp;format.&lt;/p&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>Startups, life, learning and happiness: The Anti-Todo List</title><link href="/blog/2012/11/18/2012-11-18-startups-life-learning-and-happiness-the-anti-todo/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-11-18T06:01:35-08:00</published><updated>2012-11-18T06:01:35-08:00</updated><author><name>sciencemeetproductivity</name></author><id>tag:None,2012-11-18:/blog/2012/11/18/2012-11-18-startups-life-learning-and-happiness-the-anti-todo/</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://joel.is/post/35549504055/the-anti-todo-list"&gt;via&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

And, as I use Helvetica in my own documents, I want my plot text and my document text to match, without having to go into Adobe Illustrator and change it&amp;nbsp;all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;If you&amp;#8217;ve tried to add Helvetica by editing your &lt;code&gt;.matplotlibrc&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You&amp;#8217;ve probably seen this&amp;nbsp;error:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;/Library/Frameworks/EPD64.framework/Versions/7.3/lib/python2.7/site-packages/matplotlib/font_manager.py:1216: UserWarning: findfont: Font family [&amp;#39;sans-serif&amp;#39;] not found. Falling back to Bitstream Vera Sans
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Adding Helvetica to the default font&amp;nbsp;list&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helvetica is stored in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt; X as a &lt;code&gt;.dfont&lt;/code&gt; file which is inaccessible to Matplotlib, so we need to make it accessible. We will do this in six (6)&amp;nbsp;steps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;1. Download and install &lt;em&gt;Fondu&lt;/em&gt; to convert Mac-Helvetica to&amp;nbsp;ttf-Helvetica&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EDIT&lt;/span&gt;: changed source &lt;code&gt;.tgz&lt;/code&gt; install to homebrew&amp;nbsp;install.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To install &lt;em&gt;Fondu&lt;/em&gt;, use &lt;a href="http://mxcl.github.io/homebrew/"&gt;&lt;code&gt;homebrew&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, the &amp;#8220;missing package manager for &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OSX&lt;/span&gt;.&amp;#8221; It&amp;#8217;s really fantastic, downloading and installing dependencies automagically for each&amp;nbsp;package.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After you install &lt;code&gt;homebrew&lt;/code&gt;, the command  to install &lt;em&gt;Fondu&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;is,&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;brew install fondu
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You may need to &lt;code&gt;brew update&lt;/code&gt; if you are getting an&amp;nbsp;error.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;2. Find Helvetica on your&amp;nbsp;system&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can use &amp;#8216;FontBook.app&amp;#8217; to find where Helvetica is on your system, but in all likelihood it&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;/System/Library/Fonts/Helvetica.dfont
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Need to convert this font file to &lt;code&gt;.ttf&lt;/code&gt; via &lt;em&gt;Fondu&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;3. Find where matplotlib stores its&amp;nbsp;data&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To find out where matplotlib stores its data, we use this command. Note that these outputs are specific to my machine and Python&amp;nbsp;installation.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;python&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;matplotlib&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;matplotlib&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;matplotlib_fname&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Library&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Frameworks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;EPD64&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;framework&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;Versions&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mf"&gt;7.3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;lib&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;python2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="mi"&gt;7&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;site&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;packages&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;matplotlib&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;mpl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;data&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;matplotlibrc&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;We need to put the &lt;code&gt;.ttf&lt;/code&gt; in: &lt;code&gt;matplotlib/mpl-data/fonts/ttf&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ &lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; /Library/Frameworks/EPD64.framework/Versions/7.3/lib/python2.7/site-packages/matplotlib/mpl-data/fonts/ttf/
$ sudo fondu -show /System/Library/Fonts/Helvetica.dfont  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# need sudo access to get into the .dfont directory&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;If this is not your own machine, copy the Helvetica file to somewhere you can edit, and then run&amp;nbsp;fondu:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ mkdir ~/font_copies &lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;cp /System/Library/Fonts/Helvetica.dfont ~/font_copies
$ &lt;span class="nb"&gt;cd&lt;/span&gt; /Library/Frameworks/EPD64.framework/Versions/7.3/lib/python2.7/site-packages/matplotlib/mpl-data/fonts/ttf/
$ sudo fondu -show ~/font_copies/Helvetica.dfont
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Because we specified &lt;code&gt;-show&lt;/code&gt;, which in this program is the equivalent of &lt;code&gt;--verbose&lt;/code&gt;, we see all the files that are created. I don&amp;#8217;t know why there&amp;#8217;s a bunch of &amp;#8220;Untitled&amp;#8221; files but we&amp;#8217;ll just leave them there. Now you should have a bunch of &lt;code&gt;Helvetica*.ttf&lt;/code&gt; files in this directory. Let&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;double-check:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ ls -1 Helvetica*   &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# The &amp;#39;-1&amp;#39; argument forces the output to be a single column&lt;/span&gt;
Helvetica.ttf
HelveticaBold.ttf
HelveticaBoldOblique.ttf
HelveticaLight.ttf
HelveticaLightOblique.ttf
HelveticaOblique.ttf
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BUT&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;WAIT&lt;/span&gt;. Before you can go on happily using Helvetica, you need to set Helvetica as the default font in your &lt;code&gt;.matplotlibrc&lt;/code&gt; file. Remember we found the location of your &lt;code&gt;matplotlibrc&lt;/code&gt; file using &lt;code&gt;matplotlib.matplotlib_fname()&lt;/code&gt; ?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;4. Edit your &lt;code&gt;.matplotlibrc&lt;/code&gt; file&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="http://matplotlib.org/users/customizing.html"&gt;&lt;code&gt;matplotlibrc&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; file gets read in every time you import matplotlib, and this is where you can set customizations such as default fonts and colors. Since we&amp;#8217;re good computer scientists, we&amp;#8217;re going to copy the original &lt;code&gt;.matplotlibrc&lt;/code&gt; file into a personal directory so it doesn&amp;#8217;t get over written when we update &lt;code&gt;matplotlib&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ cp /Library/Frameworks/EPD64.framework/Versions/7.3/lib/python2.7/site-packages/matplotlib/mpl-data/matplotlibrc ~/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now use your terminal-based editor of choice (mine is &lt;a href="www.gnu.org/s/emacs/"&gt;Emacs&lt;/a&gt;) to edit the&amp;nbsp;file:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ emacs -q ~/.matplotlib/matplotlibrc  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# the &amp;#39;-q&amp;#39; doesn&amp;#39;t load my .emacs file which has settings that aren&amp;#39;t compatible with my terminal&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Find the&amp;nbsp;line:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;#font.sans-serif     : Bitstream Vera Sans, Lucida Grande, Verdana, Geneva, Lucid, Arial, Helvetica, Avant Garde, sans-serif
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;This list of fonts is ordered in decreasing priority, meaning that Bitstream Vera Sans is used first, but if it&amp;#8217;s not there, use Lucida Grande, if that&amp;#8217;s not there, use Verdana, and so on. We want to uncomment it (remove the &lt;code&gt;#&lt;/code&gt;), and make Helvetica the first&amp;nbsp;priority:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;font.sans-serif     : Helvetica, Bitstream Vera Sans, Lucida Grande, Verdana, Geneva, Lucid, Arial, Helvetica, Avant Garde, sans-serif
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;You can remove Helvetica from the end of the list, but it shouldn&amp;#8217;t matter because the program will stop searching once it finds a font it&amp;nbsp;knows.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;5. Force matplotlib to re-scan the font lists and add&amp;nbsp;Helvetica&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we need to force matplotlib to re-create the font lists by removing the&amp;nbsp;files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;rm&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;~/.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;matplotlib&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fontList&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cache&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;~/.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;matplotlib&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;fontManager&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cache&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;~/.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;matplotlib&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;/&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;ttffont&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;cache&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="err"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="n"&gt;python&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;-&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;v&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# watch all the imports fly by&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;&amp;amp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;gt&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;;&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;matplotlib.pyplot&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;plt&lt;/span&gt;  &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# this will import and create the *.cache files we just removed&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I was stuck at&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;dlopen&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;(&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s2"&gt;&amp;quot;/Library/Frameworks/EPD64.framework/Versions/7.3/lib/python2.7/site-packages/matplotlib/ft2font.so&amp;quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;,&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="mi"&gt;2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;);&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;matplotlib.ft2font&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="c1"&gt;# dynamically loaded from /Library/Frameworks/EPD64.framework/Versions/7.3/lib/python2.7/site-packages/matplotlib/ft2font.so&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;for quite some time, but be patient. It &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; finish&amp;nbsp;:)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;6. Plot your figures with&amp;nbsp;Helvetica!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Helvetica!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdjt64BRCu1rw6gvj.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What if you want to use something &lt;em&gt;other&lt;/em&gt; than&amp;nbsp;Helvetica?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;If you have a &lt;code&gt;.ttf&lt;/code&gt; file for the&amp;nbsp;font&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My favorite fixed-width font is &lt;a href="http://nodnod.net/2009/feb/12/adding-straight-single-and-double-quotes-inconsola/"&gt;Inconsolata-dz&lt;/a&gt; (this fixes the weird quotations of Inconsolata), which I use in all my terminal and code editing programs. If you installed the font before installing &lt;code&gt;matplotlib&lt;/code&gt;, you can probably just use it. Let&amp;#8217;s check the fontList file just to make&amp;nbsp;sure:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;$ grep Inconsolata ~/.matplotlib/fontList.cache
S&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Inconsolata&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
S&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;/Users/olgabotvinnik/Library/Fonts/Inconsolata.otf&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
S&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Inconsolata-dz&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
S&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;/Users/olgabotvinnik/Library/Fonts/Inconsolata-dz.otf&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
aS&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;/Users/olgabotvinnik/Library/Fonts/Inconsolata.otf&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
aS&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;/Users/olgabotvinnik/Library/Fonts/Inconsolata-dz.otf&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Looks like Inconsolata&amp;#8217;s there, so let&amp;#8217;s try it out! To change your default font on the fly, add this to your&amp;nbsp;code:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="kn"&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;matplotlib&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="kn"&gt;as&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="nn"&gt;mpl&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;mpl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;rcParams&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;font.fixed-width&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;Inconsolata-dz&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="n"&gt;mpl&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="o"&gt;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;rcParams&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;[&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;font.family&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;]&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="o"&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="s1"&gt;&amp;#39;fixed-width&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h3&gt;If you do not have a &lt;code&gt;.ttf&lt;/code&gt; file for the&amp;nbsp;font&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say you&amp;#8217;re a huge fan of the sans-serif font &lt;a href="http://www.typography.com/fonts/font_overview.php?productLineID=100008"&gt;Gotham&lt;/a&gt; and want to use it for your plots. It&amp;#8217;s a proprietary font and will probably not appear as a &lt;code&gt;.ttf&lt;/code&gt; file. Follow the same steps 1-6, but find the location of your font using FontBook.app. Search for your font, and then either hit Command-R or click File &amp;#8212;&amp;gt; Show in Finder. Then drag that file into Terminal and you&amp;#8217;ll get the full path name. I use this Finder-Terminal drag and drop trick all the&amp;nbsp;time!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;To edit your final &lt;code&gt;.pdf&lt;/code&gt; files in another program such as&amp;nbsp;Illustrator&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After producing your matplotlib figures, you may still want to tweak the axis or typography. To be able to do that, edit your &lt;code&gt;~/.matplotlibrc&lt;/code&gt; file&amp;nbsp;from:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;pdf.fonttype = 3
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;To:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;pdf.fonttype = 42
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;And that&amp;#8217;ll do it! Hat tip to Benjamin&amp;nbsp;Reedlunn!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Appendix&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The code and data used to create these files can be found &lt;a href="https://github.com/olgabot/coding-cucumber/tree/master/helvetica_disordered_protein"&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. To create the file, run the&amp;nbsp;command:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;python pondrfit_plots.py -f *.pondrfit -t &amp;#39;Oct4 isoform 2&amp;#39; -c &amp;#39;#0080FF&amp;#39; -s
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;One of the hardest parts of this code was figuring out how to extract the start and end of the disordered regions (disorder score&amp;gt;0.5) when all I had was a sequential list of indices for each region. Turns out the trick is using both &lt;code&gt;itertools&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;operator&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;ranges = []
for k, g in groupby(enumerate(df_disordered.index), lambda (i,x):i-x):
    inds = map(itemgetter(1), g)
    ranges.append([inds[0], inds[-1]])
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Where &lt;code&gt;df_disordered.index&lt;/code&gt; is the indices of all the rows whose disordered score is greater than 0.5. This code is quite magical to me, as I&amp;#8217;m still figuring out &lt;code&gt;groupby&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; but I &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; understand&amp;nbsp;it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;OSX&lt;/span&gt; 10.7 (and older) Lion&amp;nbsp;users&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Apparently &amp;#8216;fondu&amp;#8217; does not install on &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OSX&lt;/span&gt; 10.7 (I&amp;#8217;m running 10.8) due to the XCode update in 10.8. One reader suggested &lt;a href="http://fontforge.org/"&gt;FontForge&lt;/a&gt; as an alternative to convert between &lt;code&gt;.dfont&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.ttf&lt;/code&gt; formats. Based on Apple&amp;#8217;s &amp;#8220;Leave old &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;#8217;s behind&amp;#8221; strategy, I&amp;#8217;m guessing users of anything older than 10.7 will also need to use&amp;nbsp;FontForge.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UPDATE&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt; This same user informed me that FontForge does not perform the full conversion necessary for &lt;code&gt;matplotlib&lt;/code&gt; in iPython (below). If you are running into a similar problem, I suggest finding someone with &lt;span class="caps"&gt;OSX&lt;/span&gt; 10.8 and getting them to do it. I cannot post the files myself because Apple technically prohibits tampering with system&amp;nbsp;fonts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;iPython&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you use &lt;a href="ipython.org"&gt;iPython&lt;/a&gt; notebooks, you may need to take an extra step for your rendered figures in &lt;code&gt;ipython notebook --pylab inline&lt;/code&gt; to appear with Helvetica. I did the&amp;nbsp;following:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Shutdown and re-open my notebook. This purges all the imports. This can also be accomplished by interrupting and restarting the kernel from within the notebook, but I wanted a full&amp;nbsp;reboot.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Edit my both my &lt;code&gt;~/.bashrc&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;./bash_profile&lt;/code&gt; (since I&amp;#8217;m not sure which one matplotlib uses) to include the text: &lt;code&gt;export MPLCONFIGDIR=$HOME/.matplotlib&lt;/code&gt;, which should tell matplotlib to look in that directory for the configuration files, such as your &lt;code&gt;.matplotlibrc&lt;/code&gt; file.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hope that&amp;nbsp;helps!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EDIT&lt;/span&gt;: Potential issues with other&amp;nbsp;fonts.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thanks to Benjamin Reedlun about the tips for specifying other fonts - it may not be as straightforward as you&amp;nbsp;hoped.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Olga, here are two other potential issues your readers might run into. I had success using your method with two different TrueType fonts, but then I tried to install TeXGyreHeros, a free Helvetica Clone with additional&amp;nbsp;characters.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;1) I found TeXGyreHeros as OpenType files (.otf extension), so I opened them up using FontForge. When I went to save TeXGyreHeros as .ttf files, FontForge pointed out that, &amp;#8220;The convention is that TrueType fonts should have an Em-size which is a power of 2.&amp;#8221; Each of the .otf font files have sizes of 1000. (In FontForge, Element &amp;gt; Font Info &amp;gt; General) Comparing the character sizes in TeXGyreHeros to those in a Helvetica.ttf, I decided to increase the size to 2^11 = 2048. After doing this, the sizes in TeXGyreHeros and Helvetica matched up reasonably well, so I saved TeXGyreHeros as .ttf&amp;nbsp;files.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;2) I placed the TeXGyreHeros.ttf files in my matplotlib/mpl-data/fonts/ttf directory, rebuilt my font lists, and specified &amp;#8220;TeXGyreHeros&amp;#8221; as my default font in Matplotlib. However, Matplotlib could not find TeXGyreHeros. After much playing around, I found that the TeXGyreHeros.ttf files had an attribute called &amp;#8220;Preferred Family&amp;#8221;. (In FontForge, go to Element &amp;gt; Font Info &amp;gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TTF&lt;/span&gt; Names.) The &amp;#8220;Preferred Family&amp;#8221; was &amp;#8220;TeX Gyre Heros&amp;#8221; (with spaces between each word). I supplied Matplotlib the font filename, &amp;#8220;TeXGyreHeros&amp;#8221;. Once I made the two names match, or deleted the &amp;#8220;Preferred Family&amp;#8221; attribute, then everything worked correctly. Looking back at the two previous TrueType fonts I installed, neither of them had the &amp;#8220;Preferred Family&amp;#8221; attribute, so that is why I did not run into this issue&amp;nbsp;before.&lt;/p&gt;

Nothing&amp;#8217;s there. Not even a speck of&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But Google said there&amp;nbsp;was!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I ran into this exact problem for an assignment this week. We were supposed to use the Disordered Protein database &lt;a href="www.disprot.org"&gt;DisProt&lt;/a&gt; and use the &lt;a href="www.disprot.org/pondr-fit.php"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PONDR&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FIT&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; algorithm to find a protein that is predicted to be disordered, but is not in the DisProt database. However, the DisProt servers went down as of noon yesterday. With the assignment due today, what are we to do? Well, the due date was pushed back but I figured out how to search Disprot even though it was down, and learned a bit about Google&amp;#8217;s &lt;a href="http://www.googleguide.com/cached_pages.html"&gt;internet caching&lt;/a&gt; (aka their plan to save all the knowledge ever publicly posted to the web.) in the&amp;nbsp;process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Viewing cached pages:&amp;nbsp;step-by-step&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do a Google search as&amp;nbsp;usual&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Hover your cursor over the result you want, and you should see two arrowheads pointing to the right: &amp;gt;&amp;gt;   Click on&amp;nbsp;them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A preview of your page should appear on the&amp;nbsp;right.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Below is an&amp;nbsp;example:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="How to view cached pages" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdicicTCHG1rw6gvj.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Turn on &amp;#8220;Verbatim&amp;#8221; mode to narrow your&amp;nbsp;results&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But what if you need to validate negative results, as we did for our assignment? Use &amp;#8220;Verbatim&amp;#8221; mode, which will stop auto-correcting your spelling to get you more result&amp;nbsp;hits.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Without &amp;#8220;Verbatim&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;mode&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Without &amp;#8220;Verbatim&amp;#8221; mode, my &amp;#8220;disprot oct4&amp;#8221; query gets mangled to &amp;#8220;disport oct4&amp;#8221; and I get lyrics for some weird band I&amp;#8217;ve never heard&amp;nbsp;of.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdicq6iryf1rw6gvj.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To turn on &amp;#8220;Verbatim&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;mode:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do a Google search as&amp;nbsp;usual&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click &amp;#8220;Search Tools&amp;#8221; in the bar below the search&amp;nbsp;box&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click &amp;#8220;All results&amp;#8221; (you want to filter so you &lt;em&gt;don&amp;#8217;t&lt;/em&gt; get all&amp;nbsp;results)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Click&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;Verbatim&amp;#8221;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A visual tutorial is&amp;nbsp;here:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdicxxZ91H1rw6gvj.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;With &amp;#8220;Verbatim&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;mode&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With &amp;#8220;Verbatim&amp;#8221; mode on, I get totally weird results which means that &amp;#8220;oct4&amp;#8221; is indeed nowhere to be found on&amp;nbsp;DisProt!&lt;/p&gt;

When asked why, both have similar answers, &amp;#8220;it&amp;#8217;s one less decision I have to make in a day.&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;[1,2]&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/74/5/1252/"&gt;Studies&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Honest-Truth-About-Dishonesty-Everyone-Especially/dp/0062183591"&gt;have&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/94/5/883/"&gt;shown&lt;/a&gt; that making decisions, even tiny ones, deplete your mental energy for the more important ones [3,4,5]. Even choosing between candy bars takes away from the energy you could have used to solve a crucial&amp;nbsp;problem!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To put as much of my non-career life on autopilot, here are three habits I&amp;#8217;ve formed that help me increase my&amp;nbsp;productivity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;No. 1: Pick out your clothes and pack your bag the night&amp;nbsp;before&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To follow Obama and Zuckerburg, don&amp;#8217;t waste your energy on picking what you put on your body. What matters is that it&amp;#8217;s appropriate and that you&amp;#8217;re&amp;nbsp;clothed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, this is something a parent would say to their child, but it works! By the end of the day my brain is usually pretty drained, but doing something semi-mindless like putting my keys and wallet back into my bag is usually fine. I check the weather for the next day and asses my outfit situation. In the morning, I don&amp;#8217;t want to be wasting my time thinking about whether my bag is ready or not &amp;#8212; I want to &lt;em&gt;go!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Southern California, this is usually &amp;#8220;short sleeves or long?&amp;#8221; But when I was in school in Boston, checking tomorrow&amp;#8217;s weather answered the more serious question of whether I needed snow boots or&amp;nbsp;not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;No. 2: Exercise (almost) every day, at the same&amp;nbsp;time&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While I&amp;#8217;m a morning person, exercising in the morning was completely repulsive to me! That&amp;#8217;s when my mind is the most fresh and when I can accomplish the most. Exercising in the morning is my body stealing time away from my mind. Until I realized I could work both my mind &lt;em&gt;and&lt;/em&gt; body in the morning! The author of &lt;a href="http://joel.is/post/24064139389/the-exercise-habit"&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt; wakes up at 5:50am, works for an hour, then goes to the gym 7am-8am, then comes home, has breakfast, and goes on with his day. (Obama)[] also touts the virtues of daily&amp;nbsp;exercise.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I experimented with this schedule of waking up, working, exercising, then getting on with the day. The difference in productivity on the days I worked out and the days I didn&amp;#8217;t was amazing. The days I worked out, I&amp;#8217;d get almost 6 hours of serious mental work in. When I didn&amp;#8217;t, I&amp;#8217;d only truly work for about three&amp;nbsp;hours.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I decided to keep doing this, and now I&amp;#8217;m waking up at  4:50am every weekday, working, then exercising 6am-7am (I started &lt;a href="http://www.beachbody.com/product/fitness_programs/insanity.do"&gt;Insanity&lt;/a&gt; two weeks ago), then getting ready and off for my day. I hate rushed mornings and it  takes me about an hour and a half to eat, make lunch, and get ready, but I&amp;#8217;m still in the process of optimizing and parallel-processing my mornings. I&amp;#8217;m aiming to get it under an hour, then under 45 minutes so I can catch my bus and get to lab before&amp;nbsp;8:15.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#8217;s important to keep your exercise at the same time every day because your body gets used to when it gets physically taxed. It&amp;#8217;s also been shown that people who exercise in the morning stick to daily workouts for&amp;nbsp;longer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;No. 3: Minimize your decisions about&amp;nbsp;food&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fortunately for me, I&amp;#8217;m getting paid less than $30K a year as a graduate student so I can&amp;#8217;t afford to go out for meals every day. So I don&amp;#8217;t have to choose what to eat at lunch every day because it&amp;#8217;s already been figured out for&amp;nbsp;me.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I love cooking, but I despise cooking every day because I think it&amp;#8217;s a waste of time. Last year at Univ. Calif. - Santa Cruz, I would make a large batch of a fried rice or pasta dish each week, and then take those leftovers to lunch with me. I&amp;#8217;ve been doing the same thing here at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UC&lt;/span&gt;-San Diego. Check out this picture from my&amp;nbsp;fridge:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Olga's refrigerator" src="https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/-EuMSvyu7ySM/UGfFd_Ph8aI/AAAAAAAAI1Y/AyzZB7zNJm0/s1223/IMAG0056.jpg"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, my shelf of the fridge is quite stuffed. I went to &lt;a href="http://www.costco.com/"&gt;Costco&lt;/a&gt; today and got a bunch of food. I&amp;#8217;ve annotated the photo, and here are some further&amp;nbsp;details:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Breakfast:&lt;/strong&gt;  I have an amazing &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Zojirushi-NS-LAC05XA-Uncooked-Cooker-Stainless/dp/B000G30ESY"&gt;rice cooker&lt;/a&gt; that has a &amp;#8220;porridge&amp;#8221; setting and a timer. At night, I pour in my 1/4 cup oatmeal, 1/4 sweetened vanilla almond milk, tablespoon of coconut milk, splash of vanilla (I really like vanilla), some salt, and 1/2 cup water into the rice cooker and set the timer for 7am. When I&amp;#8217;m done working out and showering, my food is ready! I also add in a banana, which I cut into the bowl with a spoon, and some walnuts. Very&amp;nbsp;filling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Lunch:&lt;/strong&gt; This week I made a very spicy and delicious ground beef fried rice that was a combination of these &lt;a href="http://chinesefood.about.com/od/ricefried/r/Ground-Beef-Fried-Rice-Recipe.htm"&gt;two&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href="http://www.food.com/recipe/kittencals-ground-beef-fried-rice-150499"&gt;recipes&lt;/a&gt;. I marinated the beef in soy sauce, toasted sesame oil, chili oil, salt, black pepper, and white pepper, for about 15 or so minutes in the fridge. Then I fried that up in a dutch oven, though I should have fried the chopped onion first. Then added 2 square inches of grated ginger, a whole head of minced garlic, and a tablespoon each of red pepper flakes and cayenne powder. Then came the vegetables - about four cups of frozen Normandy Mix vegetables from Costco, a cup of frozen peas, and a can of baby corn. While the vegetables were cooking, I scrambled eight (8) eggs with salt, pepper, and toasted sesame oil, and added that to the mix. Then I added three cups of brown rice and mixed it all together. Turned out quite well! Then I packed the food into several glass tupperware&amp;nbsp;containers.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Post-lunch:&lt;/strong&gt; I like having snacks around but I want them to be pre-portioned out for me. That&amp;#8217;s probably why the 100-calorie packs have taken off so well. Costco has gigantic bags of baby carrots, sugar snap peas, and broccoli florets that I packed into individual snack packs. This is great because when I pack my lunch bag in the morning, I know that I just need to grab a tupperware and a veggie bag and I&amp;#8217;m&amp;nbsp;set.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dinner:&lt;/strong&gt; I don&amp;#8217;t like eating a lot at night because it makes me feel nauseous when I lie down if I&amp;#8217;m full. Using &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/1933615486/"&gt;America&amp;#8217;s Test Kitchen&amp;#8217;s cookbook&lt;/a&gt; (highly recommended, especially for less-experienced cooks because their explanations are fabulous) as a guideline, I make a salad for dinner just about every night. My favorite is the &amp;#8220;Herb Salad&amp;#8221; mix from Trader Joe&amp;#8217;s, a handful of blueberries, 1/4 cup of freshly-toasted almonds (I just toast them in a dry skillet), several strips of parmesan shaved with a vegetable peeler, and some home made balsamic&amp;nbsp;dressing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dessert:&lt;/strong&gt; It&amp;#8217;s good to indulge. I adore the sweet/salty mix, so there&amp;#8217;s some dark chocolate with carmel and sea salt not pictured in the freezer (so it doesn&amp;#8217;t get too gooey). Other times I&amp;#8217;ll have greek yogurt with honey and blueberries. But I don&amp;#8217;t always feel like&amp;nbsp;dessert.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Recently I read a &lt;a href="http://www.nature.com/msb/journal/v3/n1/full/msb4100180.html"&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; 
that used logistic regression in its methods
and realized I had no idea what logistic regression &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt;, so I made this tutorial
for myself and others to learn about it. I wanted to create a tutorial that created 
random data that anyone could use, and taught you a bit about R in the process. This 
is my first tutorial and feedback is&amp;nbsp;encouraged.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This tutorial on the statistical machine-learning method known as Logistic
Regression is implemented in &lt;a href="r-project.org"&gt;R&lt;/a&gt;. Familiarity with programming
syntax, such as vector indexing, is assumed but I tried to make this tutorial
as accessible as possible for those with less programming&amp;nbsp;experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;What in Merlin&amp;#8217;s beard is &lt;em&gt;logistic&amp;nbsp;regression?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;First, what is &lt;em&gt;regression&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may have heard of &amp;#8220;linear regression,&amp;#8221; which fits a $y=mx+b$ line to a set of points, such as in the figure below. I&amp;#8217;m not going to go into the details of linear regression, but you can &lt;a href="http://www.stat.yale.edu/Courses/1997-98/101/linreg.htm"&gt;read about it&lt;/a&gt; if you&amp;nbsp;like.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Linear regression matches a best-fitting line to a set of data." src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdorakn4cw1rw6gvj.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- Add description of Logit function --&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Logistic regression is similar, but instead of having two continuous variables as above, one of the variables is binary (0 or 1) and the other is continuous. But we&amp;#8217;re not fitting a line, we&amp;#8217;re fitting a &lt;em&gt;logit&lt;/em&gt;, which is a totally different function that estimates probability for a continuous variable rather than assigns classification. For example, we could predict the probability
of cancer relapse given some gene expression values. Or the probability of a heart attack
given a person&amp;#8217;s cholesterol levels. We would base these probabilities on
previously encountered data, a method of machine learning known as 
&amp;#8220;Supervised Learning.&amp;#8221; You tell the computer what the answer is for many examples, and then the computer has to guess whether the outcome is 0 or&amp;nbsp;1.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think of it this way: you look at hundreds of values representing the number of 
&lt;em&gt;Star Trek: The Next Generation&lt;/em&gt; episodes a person has watched, with a teacher 
peering over your shoulder, and he tells you whether each value is associated 
with attending a &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; convention or not. Then the teacher leaves, and
you&amp;#8217;re given a new number of &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TNG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; episodes, $x$, and you have to give a 
probability $p$ whether the person who has seen this many episodes has been to a 
convention. The probability of $x$ episodes watched and no convention attendance
is $1-p$, so by knowing $p$, we also know $1-p$ and we only need to specify one&amp;nbsp;value.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Regression is not the same thing as&amp;nbsp;classification&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is an important distinction between classification and regression. If we were
doing classification, we would just say whether the person who has seen $x$ number 
of episodes has gone to a convention or not. But
we don&amp;#8217;t always want a binary outcome. The cholesterol-heart attack association is a 
great example of this. You probably don&amp;#8217;t want to tell a patient, &amp;#8220;You &lt;em&gt;will&lt;/em&gt; have a 
heart attack,&amp;#8221; but rather say &amp;#8220;You have an $x$% probability of having a heart
attack, given your current cholesterol levels.&amp;#8221; Same goes for cancer relapse. A
binary yes/no answer can obscure the data. Also, a probability of 0 is essentially 
impossible. Could you truly, definitively, say that a person will &lt;em&gt;never&lt;/em&gt; have a 
heart attack? Not until their death, but then all possible heart attack events have
already been observed. Sorry for the&amp;nbsp;gruesome-ness.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So what about this &lt;em&gt;logisitic&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;thing?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;First, we have to talk about &lt;em&gt;odds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We talked about predicting the probability of some event. But we&amp;#8217;re going to use 
&lt;em&gt;odds&lt;/em&gt; instead. If the probability of having attended a &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TNG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; convention
is $p$, then the odds&amp;nbsp;are:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\text{odds} = \frac{\text{probability of event ocurring}}{\text{probability of event not occuring}} =&amp;nbsp;\frac{p}{1-p}$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say after watching a certain number of episodes, the probability of attending a 
convention is $p=0.7$. Then the odds of attending a convention&amp;nbsp;are &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\frac{0.7}{0.3} =&amp;nbsp;2.333\ldots$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the odds of not attending a convention&amp;nbsp;are &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\frac{0.3}{0.7} =&amp;nbsp;0.4285\ldots$$ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As you can see, odds and probability are not the same. Odds can be greater than 1, and probability must be between 0 and&amp;nbsp;1. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Next, we have to define &lt;em&gt;log-odds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It would be nice if these odds were somehow symmetric and we could intuitively make 
inferences just by looking at the value. This is where the logarithm comes in. If we 
take the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_logarithm"&gt;natural log&lt;/a&gt; (ln), aka 
$\log_e$ of the odds of attending a convention, we&amp;nbsp;get&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\ln \frac{0.7}{0.3} =&amp;nbsp;0.8472\ldots$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And the log-odds of &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; attending a&amp;nbsp;convention:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\frac{0.3}{0.7} =&amp;nbsp;-0.8472\ldots$$ &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The opposite of attending a convention is the negative of attending a convention! 
Now let&amp;#8217;s stop and think. &lt;em&gt;Why&lt;/em&gt; is this? This is because the natural log of 1 is 0,
so it intersects at 0 as in the plot below. Then the natural log of anything smaller 
than 1 is negative, approaching negative infinity as the number gets closer and 
closer to 0. The natural log of anything larger than 1 is positive, and approaches 
positive infinity as the number gets larger and larger, but slower than we approach 
negative infinity from the other&amp;nbsp;side. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Natural log function" src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdorb7uHwT1rw6gvj.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This symmetry is helpful to guide our intuition about events occurring or not&amp;nbsp;occuring.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FYI&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/em&gt; We used the natural logarithm here because that&amp;#8217;s the standard. You could
really use any log base you like, even $\log_\pi$ would do, but it&amp;#8217;s just not
used that&amp;nbsp;often.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;From log-odds to &lt;em&gt;logits&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The log-odds are also called the &lt;em&gt;logit&lt;/em&gt; of the&amp;nbsp;probability:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$ \log(\text{odds}) = \text{logit}(p) = \ln\left( \frac{p}{1-p} \right)&amp;nbsp;$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In logistic regression, we&amp;nbsp;set &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$\text{logit}(p) = a_0 + a_1x_1 + a_2x_2, \ldots ,&amp;nbsp;a_nx_n$$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Where $n$ is the number of independent variables you have. In our case, we just have one independent variable, $x = x_1$, the number of &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TNG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; episodes viewed. But we could add to the complexity and also have $x_2$ be the number of &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: The Original Series&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href="http://mashable.com/2012/09/07/google-star-trek/"&gt;happy 46th anniversary!&lt;/a&gt;) episodes viewed, $x_3$ be number of &lt;a href="http://en.memory-alpha.org/wiki/Latinum"&gt;latinum strips&lt;/a&gt; owned, and $x_4$ be &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Star-Trek-Conversational-Marc-Okrand/dp/0671797395"&gt;Klingon language proficiency&lt;/a&gt;. But we&amp;#8217;re going to keep it simple and stick to our one&amp;nbsp;$x$.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we could do regular ol&amp;#8217; linear regression on this, but there are several&amp;nbsp;issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We have a binary variable for our dependent variable (aka the $y$), and linear regression assumes a continuous distribution for the dependent variable. With probability as the output, we cannot have values less than 0 or greater than 1, and linear regression does not conform to&amp;nbsp;this.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The variance of $y$ is not constant across values of $x$. The variance is $p(1-p) = pq$ ($q$ is short for $1-p$), and if we have a probability of $0.50$ of attending a &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt; convention, then we have $0.5\times 0.5 = 0.25$ odds. But if we have $p=0.9$, then the variance $pq = 0.9\times 0.1 = 0.09$, and $0.25 \neq 0.09$. Thus the assumption that variance of $y$ is constant across values of $x$ is invalid. This is also called &lt;a href="http://blog.minitab.com/blog/statistics-and-quality-data-analysis/dont-be-a-victim-of-statistical-hippopotomonstrosesquipedaliophobia"&gt;homoscedasticity&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If you want to do significance testing (you maybe familiar with &lt;em&gt;p&lt;/em&gt;-values or &lt;em&gt;R&lt;/em&gt;-values to describe how significant a result is), the assumption that the errors of prediction, $Y-Y^\prime$ are &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal_distribution"&gt;normally distributed&lt;/a&gt; doesn&amp;#8217;t work. $Y$ only takes on the values 0 and 1, so there&amp;#8217;s no way you can create a continuous distribution such as a normal distribution with just two&amp;nbsp;values.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Logits are not very intuitive as a unit, even though they are very helpful when looking at odds. But we need to get back to probabilities so we can give a probability of convention attendance. We&amp;#8217;ll have to exponentiate both sides to get rid of the natural log. I&amp;#8217;m going to keep the long-form version of the equation so you can see how it works for more&amp;nbsp;variables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
\begin{align}
\text{logit}(p) &amp;amp;= \ln\left( \frac{p}{1-p} \right) = a_0 + a_1x_1 + a_2x_2, \ldots , a_nx_n\newline
\frac{p}{1-p} &amp;amp;= e^{a_0 + a_1x_1 + a_2x_2, \ldots , a_nx_n} \newline
p &amp;amp;= (1-p)e^{a_0 + a_1x_1 + a_2x_2, \ldots , a_nx_n} \newline
p + p(e^{-(a_0 + a_1x_1 + a_2x_2, \ldots , a_nx_n)}) &amp;amp;= 1 \newline
1 + e^{`(a_0 + a_1x_1 + a_2x_2, \ldots , a_nx_n)} &amp;amp;= \frac{1}{p}\newline
\frac{1}{1+e^{-(a_0 + a_1x_1 + a_2x_2, \ldots , a_nx_n)}} &amp;amp;= p
\end{align}&amp;nbsp;$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can multiply the fraction by a clever form of 1, $e^{(a_0 + a_1x_1 + a_2x_2, \ldots , a_nx_n)}/e^{(a_0 + a_1x_1 + a_2x_2, \ldots , a_nx_n)}$ to&amp;nbsp;get&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$$
p = \frac{e^{(a_0 + a_1x_1 + a_2x_2, \ldots , a_nx_n)}}{1+e^{(a_0 + a_1x_1 + a_2x_2, \ldots , a_nx_n)}}.&amp;nbsp;$$&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If we set $a_1 = 1$ and all other $a_0, a_2, a_3, \ldots = 0$, then we get the general logit cuve&amp;nbsp;below&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The logit curve ranges from negative infinity to positive infinity on the x-axis, and from 0 to 1 on the y-axis." src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdorbq7Ixx1rw6gvj.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now we have a way of creating a predictor of the probability of a binary variable from a continuous variable. Now let&amp;#8217;s get started with doing&amp;nbsp;regression.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;PS&lt;/span&gt;, if you want to get math typesetting (aka LaTeX) on your blog, I recommend 
&lt;strong&gt;against&lt;/strong&gt; searching for &amp;#8220;tumblr latex&amp;#8221; and instead checking out &lt;a href="http://checkmyworking.com/2012/01/how-to-get-beautifully-typeset-maths-on-your-blog/"&gt;this tutorial&lt;/a&gt; on installing MathJax on your blog, tumblr or&amp;nbsp;not.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Step 1: Get binary&amp;nbsp;data.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Initialize a vector of&amp;nbsp;0&amp;#8217;s&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For this case, we are going to make up some binary data. According to &lt;a href="http://www.statgun.com/tutorials/logistic-regression.html"&gt;a nice explanation of logistic regression&lt;/a&gt;,
logistic regression requires at least 50 data points per classification. Meaning, 
50+ 0&amp;#8217;s and 50+ 1&amp;#8217;s. There are 178 total &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TNG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; episodes and lots of bonus 
features and interviews on the DVDs, so let&amp;#8217;s round up to 200 total &lt;em&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TNG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; pieces of 
video. In R, &lt;code&gt;rep&lt;/code&gt; is the function to create a vector of repeated values. The
first argument is what you want repeated, and the second argument is how
many times you want to repeat it. You could even have a vector in the first 
argument, such as &lt;code&gt;rep(c("red", "blue"), 30)&lt;/code&gt;, to get a vector of alternating 
strings, &amp;#8220;red&amp;#8221; and &amp;#8220;blue.&amp;#8221; We could have also made the same vector
with &lt;code&gt;classification = vector(length=200, mode="numeric")&lt;/code&gt;, which initializes
the numeric values at 0, but I decided to do it with &lt;code&gt;rep&lt;/code&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="n"&gt;classification&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span class="n"&gt;rep&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span class="mi"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;,&lt;span class="mi"&gt;200&lt;/span&gt;)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;EDIT&lt;/span&gt;: I&amp;#8217;ve been informed that at 50+ data points is not always necessary, so take the rule with a grain of&amp;nbsp;salt.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Set a random&amp;nbsp;seed&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s set the random seed so we will get consistently the same results, no
matter how many times we run the code. No random number generator is truly random,
and part of the semi-randomness is starting with a seed number, and then doing 
all kinds of transformations to then get a &amp;#8220;random&amp;#8221; number. So if we make sure
we are always using the same seed, then we will always get the same set of
&amp;#8220;random&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;numbers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;set.seed(100)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;Randomly add 1s to the last part of the&amp;nbsp;vector&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now let&amp;#8217;s randomly add a bunch of 1s to the vector, ramping up the probability of 
getting a one (with hyperbolic growth, if you&amp;#8217;re being technical) as we get to 
the end of the vector. Let&amp;#8217;s be interesting and add some noise to the data so 
we don&amp;#8217;t have not do an equal 50/50 split. We&amp;#8217;ll use a randomly-generated
probability distribution to assign 0 or 1 to the last 125 values. This way, our
data is a little more realistic and less&amp;nbsp;clean.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FYI&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;code&gt;runif&lt;/code&gt; is the &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_distribution_(continuous)"&gt;uniform distribution function&lt;/a&gt;
in R, which has an equal probability of obtaining every value between 0 and 1.
It is useful in this assignment because I know that the odds are 50/50 that
the value will be greater than 0.5, so I increased the threshold to &amp;gt;0.6
and added a multiplicative factor, which varies from 1 to 125. This way, the
values near the beginning of the vector have close to a 60/40 chance of being
less than 0.6, but by the end, they are almost certainly all above 0.6.
Take a look&amp;nbsp;below.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The multiplicative factor:
&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FYI&lt;/span&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;str&lt;/code&gt; function is a method of previewing the first few values of
variables without seeing everything at once. It can be handy. Another method is
&lt;code&gt;head&lt;/code&gt;, which like the *&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIX&lt;/span&gt; head, shows the first few values, but it can
be annoying if you have a matrix with a large number of columns, say over 100. Then
you get the first 10 values for all 100 columns, which takes up a lot of space. &lt;code&gt;str&lt;/code&gt;
can be more convenient in that&amp;nbsp;case.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; str(125/125:1)
 num [1:125] 1 1.01 1.02 1.02 1.03 ...
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Randomly generated values in the uniform distribution:
(Notice that I re-set the random number seed. This is because after
a random seed is used, the random number generator advances to the next&amp;nbsp;seed.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; set.seed(100); str(runif(125))
 num [1:125] 0.3078 0.2577 0.5523 0.0564 0.4685 ...
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Multiplicative factor times the uniform distribution vector:
(For those Linear Algebra lovers out there, we don&amp;#8217;t get a matrix because by 
default, R multiplies vectors on an element-by-element basis. If you want
the usual vector product, aka the cross product, do &lt;code&gt;vector1 %*% vector2&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; set.seed(100); str(runif(125)*(125/125:1))
 num [1:125] 0.3078 0.2598 0.5613 0.0578 0.484 ...
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Now we can use &lt;code&gt;ifelse&lt;/code&gt; to assign a 0 or 1 based on whether the vector we just
created is greater than 0.6 or&amp;nbsp;not.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;set.seed(100); classification[76:200] = ifelse(runif(125)*(125/125:1) &amp;gt; 0.6, 1, 0)
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;The final binary&amp;nbsp;vector&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is what I get for the binary classification vector. Keep in mind that we only 
added 1&amp;#8217;s to the last 125 values, or from index 76 and&amp;nbsp;up.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; classification
  [1] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 [38] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
 [75] 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 0 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 0 1 1 1
[112] 0 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1
[149] 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 0 0 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 0 1
[186] 1 1 1 1 1 0 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1 1
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h1&gt;Step 2: Get some continuous&amp;nbsp;data.&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;#8217;re going to make up continuous data similarly to how we created the binary 
classification vector. This time, we set the next seed so we&amp;#8217;d get different 
numbers, and multiplied a uniform distribution by a linear function. Now this isn&amp;#8217;t
quite enough to make most of the 1&amp;#8217;s be in the upper numbers and most of the 0&amp;#8217;s
be in the lower numbers, so we add a linearly increasing amount of Gaussian noise
to the&amp;nbsp;values.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;set.seed(101); continuous = runif(200)*1:200+rnorm(200,mean=50,sd=5)*1:200
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;My continuous vector looks like&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; str(continuous)
 num [1:200] 51.7 94.2 184.1 226.1 269.9 ...
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;As you can see, we have values larger than 200, but we assumed there are 200 pieces of &lt;em&gt;Star Trek: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;TNG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; video media to watch, so we need to normalize it by the max. Now our maximum value is 1, so we multiply by 200 to get a maximum value of&amp;nbsp;200.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&amp;gt; continuous = continuous/max(continuous) * 200
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;h2&gt;What does our data look&amp;nbsp;like?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now if we plot the continuous vector vs the binary vector, we&amp;#8217;ll see that in general,
the 0&amp;#8217;s occur in the lower end of the continuous spectrum, and the 1&amp;#8217;s occur in the
higher end of the continuous&amp;nbsp;spectrum.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;!-- fix data because continuous goes up to 10,000 --&gt;

&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;png(&amp;quot;~/workspace/tutorials/logistic_regression_points.png&amp;quot;)
plot(continuous, classification, pch=20, col=&amp;quot;blue&amp;quot;)
dev.off()
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="The continuous vector on the x-axis vs the binary vector in the y-axis. Notice that most of the values classified as 0 appear with lower continuous values, and the values classified as 1 appear with higher continuous values." src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdorcfiIYs1rw6gvj.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So according to our data, there&amp;#8217;s a lot of people who have seen &lt;em&gt;most&lt;/em&gt; of &lt;em&gt;Star Trek:&lt;span class="caps"&gt;TNG&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; and have been to a convention, but there are a few individuals who have seen most of it and yet have not been a&amp;nbsp;convention.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Step 3: Do logistic&amp;nbsp;regression!&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now you can use generalized linear models to fit to the data. Note: This is one of many methods in R to do logistic regression, and I chose to do the simplest version. Note that &lt;code&gt;classification ~ continuous&lt;/code&gt; is shorthand for &lt;code&gt;y ~ x&lt;/code&gt;, or as the R people say, &lt;code&gt;response ~ terms&lt;/code&gt;. If you had more data points, like Klingon language profiency, you would add this variable by using the &lt;code&gt;cbind&lt;/code&gt; or &amp;#8220;column bind&amp;#8221; function which would create a 2-column matrix from the two vectors: &lt;code&gt;glm(classification ~ cbind(continuous, klingon), ...)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;glm.out = glm(classification ~ continuous, family=binomial(logit))&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;png(&amp;quot;~/workspace/tutorials/logistic_fitted.png&amp;quot;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;plot(continuous, glm.out&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="p"&gt;$&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="nv"&gt;fitted&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class="x"&gt;, type=&amp;quot;l&amp;quot;, col=&amp;quot;red&amp;quot;, lwd=1, main=&amp;quot;Logistic function fitted to classification data\nvia a generalized linear model&amp;quot;)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;points(continuous, classification, col=&amp;quot;blue&amp;quot;, pch=20)&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;span class="x"&gt;dev.off()&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The plot of the fitted curve looks&amp;nbsp;like:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="Logistic curve fitted to data." src="http://media.tumblr.com/tumblr_mdorcxMktg1rw6gvj.png"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;So what actually happened&amp;nbsp;here?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;glm&lt;/code&gt; function found the values of $a_0$ and $a_1$ that minimize the error term. I&amp;#8217;m not qualified to describe &lt;code&gt;glm&lt;/code&gt; in gory detail, or all the other possible methods of calculating logistic regression, but &lt;a href="http://www.omidrouhani.com/research/logisticregression/html/logisticregression.htm#_Toc147483467"&gt;this site&lt;/a&gt; gives the mathematics the justice it deserves. You will need to be familiar with linear algebra to fully understand the&amp;nbsp;arguments.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;FAQ&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What if your classification is 1 for the low values and 0 for the high&amp;nbsp;values?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can still use the same steps, but your logit curve will be flipped along the&amp;nbsp;$y$-axis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;Have you attended a &lt;em&gt;Star Trek&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;convention?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No, I have not. But I thought it would be a fun binary&amp;nbsp;variable.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;References&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could not have done this without the help of many different&amp;nbsp;sources.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;http://luna.cas.usf.edu/~mbrannic/files/regression/Logistic.html - the first thing I read, and the primary source for the explanation of logistic regression in the first section (&lt;em&gt;What in Merlin&amp;#8217;s beard is logistic regression?&lt;/em&gt;). Highly recommended introduction to logistic&amp;nbsp;regression.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logistic_regression - Wikipedia is a great place to start, but it dove into the technical aspects a little too quickly for my&amp;nbsp;taste.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;http://www.statgun.com/tutorials/logistic-regression.html - a great explanation of logistic regression in&amp;nbsp;general.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This post is aimed at undergraduate juniors/seniors who are planning to apply for graduate/professional school in Fall 2012. &lt;strong&gt;Disclaimer: I am not an expert in requesting letters.&lt;/strong&gt; This is a guide from my application experience and advice from faculty, as well as &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MD&lt;/span&gt; and PhD&amp;nbsp;applicants.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Requesting a letter of recommendation is always a a tricky situation. I&amp;#8217;m in this exact situation for fellowship applications this&amp;nbsp;fall.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Recommendations: More than just&amp;nbsp;letters&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first thing you need to understand about recommendation letters is that it&amp;#8217;s not just a piece of writing. The faculty have to rank you vs all the other people they&amp;#8217;ve had at your relative position, then vs all undergrads, plus they assess your maturity, character, communication skills, and all that. It&amp;#8217;s a lot of forms. So you want to make all those steps as easy as possible for your&amp;nbsp;recommender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;When to ask: as early as possible (1.5-2+ months in&amp;nbsp;advance)&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Faculty are busy people. In a recent correspondence with a faculty member, they told me they are traveling for the next eight weeks and I won&amp;#8217;t be able to make an appointment with them until late October or November. If you are asking a particularly busy faculty, I recommend at &lt;strong&gt;least two months ahead of&amp;nbsp;time.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;Writing a glowing recommendation about you should be as easy as&amp;nbsp;possible&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whoever you ask for your recommendation letters, they are probably people who have positive views of you and your work. However, they may not have the time or energy necessary to write you the glowing recommendation that they think you deserve. So, help them out by doing some of the work&amp;nbsp;yourself!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you request a letter of recommendation, you should give them as much information as you can so that &lt;strong&gt;your recommender will write a fantastic letter of recommendation with the least possible friction&lt;/strong&gt;. This information should be in the form of a bound packet. The &amp;#8220;packet&amp;#8221; idea came from my accomplished friend Jia Zhu, currently in her second year at Harvard Medical School (check out &lt;a href="http://hms.harvard.edu/content/nurturing-passion-research"&gt;her research&lt;/a&gt; from this&amp;nbsp;summer!).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What I put in my&amp;nbsp;packet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cover&amp;nbsp;page&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dear Professor X, I am writing to request the possibility of a recommendation ……. Here are all the awesome things I did while working with&amp;nbsp;you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Table of&amp;nbsp;Contents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;List of schools/fellowships with&amp;nbsp;deadlines&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Photos of you doing awesome&amp;nbsp;things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Essay&amp;nbsp;drafts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Transcripts&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Test&amp;nbsp;scores&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;My packet as an&amp;nbsp;example&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here is my packet &lt;a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/boxi0fdyphmuigg/OlgaBotvinnik_RecommendationPacket.pdf?dl=0"&gt;[&lt;span class="caps"&gt;21MB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;PDF&lt;/span&gt;]&lt;/a&gt;, edited for privacy, which I gave to one of my recommenders. You may notice a table of contents. After I printed out the packet, I &lt;a href="http://www.fedex.com/us/office/binding-finishing-laminating.html"&gt;coil-bound it at Kinko&amp;#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; with a cardstock back and hand-wrote the page numbers on each page. As for the essays in the packet, keep in mind that these were truly draft essays and that my final submissions were quite different. Also, I did not win a Hertz or Paul and Daisy Soros fellowship, so they are not examples of winning essays. I did, however, receive an Honorable Mention for my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NSF&lt;/span&gt; essays, though the one in here is not the final version. There will be more posts about essay writing&amp;nbsp;later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2&gt;What you should put in your&amp;nbsp;packet&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cover page (Fall 2011 Recommendation Packet for [Your&amp;nbsp;Name])&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Dear Professor X, I am writing to request the possibility of a recommendation ……. Here are all the awesome things I did while working with&amp;nbsp;you&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Draft&amp;nbsp;letters&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Table of&amp;nbsp;Contents&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;List of schools/fellowships with&amp;nbsp;deadlines&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CV&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Photos of you doing awesome&amp;nbsp;things&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Essay&amp;nbsp;drafts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;bolded&lt;/strong&gt; items are what I consider to be the most important ones, and I&amp;#8217;ll tell you&amp;nbsp;why.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Draft letters are how you ensure high-quality&amp;nbsp;recommendations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Draft letters are &lt;strong&gt;incredibly important&lt;/strong&gt;. Last year was the first time I was asked for a draft letter and it caught me off-guard. Be prepared by writing your own letter of recommendation. As you know from your university writing classes, it is &lt;em&gt;much&lt;/em&gt; easier to edit an existing piece of writing than to start from scratch. What you absolutely do not want is for the professor to say &amp;#8220;this person took my course as a junior and received an&amp;nbsp;A.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You may need to include several different draft letters for your recommenders. For example, maybe you are applying to fellowship &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; that emphasizes service, then the draft letter for fellowship &lt;em&gt;A&lt;/em&gt; should talk about the service you performed &lt;em&gt;in relation to the recommender.&lt;/em&gt; You do not want to have your research supervisor speak volumes about your service record when they&amp;#8217;ve never seen you in action. Hopefully you have a recommender who can directly speak about your service work, and then you can emphasize which projects or roles are most pertinent to this&amp;nbsp;fellowship.&lt;/p&gt;

He also has tips on &lt;a href="http://www.cs.washington.edu/homes/mernst/advice/request-recommendation.html"&gt;requesting letters of recommendation&lt;/a&gt;, which I highly encourage you to&amp;nbsp;read.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Essay&amp;nbsp;drafts&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Essay drafts (even the very beginnings of one!) are very important because they show your recommender why you want to go to graduate school. Your recommender will see how you present yourself to the committee, and can write a complementary letter. I also suggest a conversation with your recommender about your goals for graduate&amp;nbsp;school.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Do not assume your recommender/their assistant remembers when all your deadlines&amp;nbsp;are&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I made this mistake as I emailed a reminder to my very early (October 31st) first fellowship deadline the day before it was due, and turns out some of my recommenders were totally oblivious to when everything was. Even though I e-mailed a fancy spreadsheet with all the deadlines and I put them all in the&amp;nbsp;packet!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, the timeline would look like&amp;nbsp;this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1-2 months before (aim for 3 months) - Request recommendations via the&amp;nbsp;packet&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If they agree and have not yet&amp;nbsp;submitted:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 month before - remind about deadline, update with anything cool you&amp;#8217;ve done so&amp;nbsp;far&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;2 weeks before - remind about&amp;nbsp;deadline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;1 week before - remind about&amp;nbsp;deadline&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, after they submit, you don&amp;#8217;t need to remind them&amp;nbsp;anymore.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Other (hopefully obvious)&amp;nbsp;tips&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be honest in your packet and in your&amp;nbsp;application.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Waive your right to read the letter. The committee will trust the letter more, and the recommender will be free to speak their&amp;nbsp;mind.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be courteous in all your interactions with your recommenders and the admissions&amp;nbsp;committees. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;If there are any faculty reading this&amp;nbsp;post&amp;#8230;&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can you answer these questions for&amp;nbsp;me?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;If someone were to request a letter of recommendation, should they ask by email or by sending the packet? I like the packet because then it shows I really want them but maybe I should request, and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;THEN&lt;/span&gt; send. My strategy this year was to send the packet and then send an email saying I sent a packet to ask for the possibility of a recommendation. Nobody declined but I&amp;#8217;m&amp;nbsp;curious.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should I update you with my newest drafts of essays? do you&amp;nbsp;care?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Should I update you with cool things I started doing since I sent you that&amp;nbsp;packet?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;After you find out about fellowships and/or decide on&amp;nbsp;schools&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Say &amp;#8220;Thank you, thank you, thank you!&amp;#8221; Your recommenders did a lot of work for you so make sure you appreciate them, and tell them where you got in! Writing recommendation letters is part of their job, so gifts are not&amp;nbsp;appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1&gt;It&amp;#8217;s a lot of&amp;nbsp;work&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a lot of information, and a lot of work. But remember, you want to &lt;strong&gt;make the letter-writing process as easy as possible for your recommender.&lt;/strong&gt; I cannot emphasize this enough. Whoever your recommenders are, they are well-intended busy people who want you to do well, but may not have enough time to write the ideal letter of recommendation. Help them&amp;nbsp;out!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do you have any suggestions for writing recommendations that I missed?

It only includes reads from chromosome 9, an arbitrary choice to reduce the time of running the example. Currently, the example takes 20 minutes to run on my laptop (MacBook Pro, Late 2008 model, 2.4G Hz Intel Core Duo, 4 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GB&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RAM&lt;/span&gt;), and this is really supposed to be run on a server that holds all your gigantic (10gb+) &lt;code&gt;.bam&lt;/code&gt; files. If you do choose to run it on your own personal computer, I would recommend leaving your computer alone while it runs, or else your entire machine may crash. Mine&amp;nbsp;has.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h1&gt;The&amp;nbsp;inputs&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Basically, the inputs are (they will be more thoroughly described&amp;nbsp;below):&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Output&amp;nbsp;directory&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Metadata file with the &lt;code&gt;.bam&lt;/code&gt; file locations, sample IDs, and experiment&amp;nbsp;descriptions&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Gene transfer format file (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GTF&lt;/span&gt; file, a subset of the General Feature Format, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GFF&lt;/span&gt; filetypes) of genes for your&amp;nbsp;species&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GTF&lt;/span&gt; file processed with DEXSeq, a differential exon usage&amp;nbsp;program.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Browser-extensible data (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BED&lt;/span&gt;) file of genes for your species. Both the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BED&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GTF&lt;/span&gt; files are needed for the different transcript-counting programs (&lt;code&gt;bedtools Coverage&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;htseq-count&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Transcript &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt; &amp;ndash; Symbol file (explained&amp;nbsp;below)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/span&gt;Genome&amp;rdquo; file. This is available in your BEDTools distribution for mouse and human (mm8, mm9, hg18 and hg19), and I&amp;rsquo;ll show you an example of one so you can create one for other species,&amp;nbsp;too.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;ldquo;&lt;/span&gt;Karyotype&amp;rdquo; file for &lt;a href="http://circos.ca/"&gt;Circos&lt;/a&gt; plotting. This is available in your Circos distribution for mouse and human (mm8, mm9, hg18 and hg19), and again, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you an example so you can create your&amp;nbsp;own.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Gene density file, for &lt;a href="http://circos.ca/"&gt;Circos&lt;/a&gt; plotting. I have created one for humans (hg19) and will give instructions and a script for how to create one on your&amp;nbsp;own.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GC&lt;/span&gt; content file, for &lt;a href="http://circos.ca/"&gt;Circos&lt;/a&gt; plotting. I have one for humans, chromosome 9 (it takes a long time to plot if it is very dense, so I chose a subset of the genome), and will show you how to create your&amp;nbsp;own&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Number of &amp;ldquo;bunches&amp;rdquo; you&amp;rsquo;d like to create (more on this&amp;nbsp;later)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;   &lt;h1&gt;The&amp;nbsp;outputs&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;p&gt;And after submitting all those files and waiting ~20 min for the example to finish, you&amp;nbsp;get:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Quality-control plots of the &lt;code&gt;.bam&lt;/code&gt; files, via &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/rseqc/"&gt;RSeQC&lt;/a&gt;. Most of the commands listed in the &lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/rseqc/wiki/Manual"&gt;manual&lt;/a&gt; are performed. In alphabetical order, they are (with documentation copy/pasted from the RSeQC manual):  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/rseqc/wiki/Manual#clipping_profile.py"&gt;&lt;code&gt;clipping_profile.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: This program is used estimate clipping profile of &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RNA&lt;/span&gt;-seq reads from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BAM&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SAM&lt;/span&gt; file. Note that to use this function, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CIGAR&lt;/span&gt; strings within &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SAM&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;BAM&lt;/span&gt; file should have &lt;code&gt;S&lt;/code&gt; operation (This means your reads mapper should support clipped&amp;nbsp;mapping).&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/rseqc/wiki/Manual#geneBody_coverage.py"&gt;&lt;code&gt;geneBody_coverage.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Read coverage over gene body. This module is used to check if reads coverage is uniform and if there is any 5’/3’ bias. This module scales all transcripts to 100 nt and calculates the number of reads covering each nucleotide position. Finally, it generates a plot illustrating the coverage profile along the gene body. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NOTE&lt;/span&gt;: this module requires lots of memory for large &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BAM&lt;/span&gt; files, because it load the entire &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BAM&lt;/span&gt; file into memory.  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;This is a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VERY&lt;/span&gt; useful function to look at how fully covered the transcripts are in your experiment. I highly recommend taking a look at the gene body coverage before interpreting differential&amp;nbsp;expression.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/rseqc/wiki/Manual#geneBody_coverage.py"&gt;&lt;code&gt;infer_experiment.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: This program is used to speculate how &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RNA&lt;/span&gt;-seq sequencing were configured, especially how reads were stranded for strand-specific &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RNA&lt;/span&gt;-seq data, through comparing reads&amp;#8217; mapping information to the underneath gene model.  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Note: currently, RPKM_count.py does not take in the infer_experiment data but will in the&amp;nbsp;future.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/rseqc/wiki/Manual#inner_distance.py"&gt;&lt;code&gt;inner_distance.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: This module is used to calculate the inner distance (or insert size) between two paired &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RNA&lt;/span&gt; reads. The distance is the mRNA length between two paired&amp;nbsp;fragments.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/rseqc/wiki/Manual#junction_annotation.py"&gt;&lt;code&gt;junction_annotation.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: For a given alignment file (&lt;code&gt;-i&lt;/code&gt;) in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BAM&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SAM&lt;/span&gt; format and a reference gene model (&lt;code&gt;-r&lt;/code&gt;) in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BED&lt;/span&gt; format, this program will compare detected splice junction to reference gene&amp;nbsp;model.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/rseqc/wiki/Manual#junction_saturation.py"&gt;&lt;code&gt;junction_saturation.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: It&amp;rsquo;s very important to check if current sequencing depth is deep enough to perform alternative splicing analyses. For a well annotated organism, the number of expressed genes in particular tissue is almost fixed so the number of splice junctions is also fixed,　all splice junctions can be predetermined according to reference gene model. All (annotated) splice junctions should be rediscovered from a saturated &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RNA&lt;/span&gt;-seq data, otherwise, downstream alternative splicing analysis is problematic because low abundance splice junctions are missing. This module checks for saturation by resampling 5%, 10%, 15%, &amp;hellip;, 95% of total alignments from &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BAM&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SAM&lt;/span&gt; file, and then detects splice junctions from each subset and compares them to reference gene&amp;nbsp;model.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/rseqc/wiki/Manual#read_distribution.py"&gt;&lt;code&gt;read_distribution.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Provided a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BAM&lt;/span&gt;/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;SAM&lt;/span&gt; file and reference gene model, this module will calculate how mapped reads were distributed over genome feature (like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CDS&lt;/span&gt; exon, 5&amp;#8217;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UTR&lt;/span&gt; exon, 3&amp;#8217; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UTR&lt;/span&gt; exon, Intron, Intergenic regions). When genome features are overlapped (e.g. a region could be annotated as both exon and intron by two different transcripts) , they are prioritize as: &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CDS&lt;/span&gt; exons &gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UTR&lt;/span&gt; exons &gt; Introns &gt; Intergenic regions, for example,if a read was mapped to both &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CDS&lt;/span&gt; exon and intron, it will be assigned to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CDS&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;exons.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/rseqc/wiki/Manual#read_duplication.py"&gt;&lt;code&gt;read_duplication.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Two strategies were used to determine reads duplication rate:  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Sequence based: reads with exactly the same sequence content are regarded as duplicated&amp;nbsp;reads.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Mapping based: reads mapped to the same genomic location are regarded as duplicated reads. For splice reads, reads mapped to the same starting position and splice the same way are regarded as duplicated&amp;nbsp;reads.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/rseqc/wiki/Manual#read_GC.py"&gt;&lt;code&gt;read_GC.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Finds the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GC&lt;/span&gt; content of your reads and outputs a histogram&amp;nbsp;plot.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/rseqc/wiki/Manual#read_NVC.py"&gt;&lt;code&gt;read_NVC.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: This module is used to check the nucleotide composition bias. Due to random priming, certain patterns are over represented at the beginning (5&amp;#8217;end) of reads. This bias could be easily examined by &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NVC&lt;/span&gt; (Nucleotide versus cycle) plot. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;NVC&lt;/span&gt; plot is generated by overlaying all reads together, then calculating nucleotide composition for each position of read (or each sequencing cycle). In ideal condition (genome is random and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RNA&lt;/span&gt;-seq reads is randomly sampled from genome), we expect A%=C%=G%=T%=25% at each position of reads.  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;I also highly recommend looking at this plot and possibly trimming the first 6-9bp of your&amp;nbsp;reads.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/rseqc/wiki/Manual#read_quality.py"&gt;&lt;code&gt;read_quality.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: According to &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SAM&lt;/span&gt; specification, if Q is the character to represent &amp;ldquo;base calling quality&amp;rdquo; in &lt;span class="caps"&gt;SAM&lt;/span&gt; file, then Phred Quality Score = &lt;code&gt;ord(Q) - 33&lt;/code&gt;. Here &lt;code&gt;ord()&lt;/code&gt; is python function that returns an integer representing the Unicode code point of the character when the argument is a unicode object, for example, &lt;code&gt;ord('a')&lt;/code&gt; returns 97. Phred quality score is widely used to measure &amp;ldquo;reliability&amp;rdquo; of base-calling, for example, phred quality score of 20 means there is 1/100 chance that the base-calling is wrong, phred quality score of 30 means there is 1/1000 chance that the base-calling is wrong. In general: Phred quality score = &lt;code&gt;-10*log10P&lt;/code&gt;, here &lt;code&gt;P&lt;/code&gt; is probability that base-calling is&amp;nbsp;wrong.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/rseqc/wiki/Manual#RPKM_count.py"&gt;&lt;code&gt;RPKM_count.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Given a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BAM&lt;/span&gt; file and reference gene model, this program will calculate the raw count and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RPKM&lt;/span&gt; values for transcript at exon, intron and mRNA level. For strand specific &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RNA&lt;/span&gt;-seq data, program will assign read to its parental gene according to strand rule, if you don&amp;rsquo;t know the strand rule, run &lt;code&gt;infer_experiment.py&lt;/code&gt;. Please note that chromosome &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt;, genome cooridinates should be concordant between &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BAM&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="caps"&gt;BED&lt;/span&gt;&amp;nbsp;files.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/rseqc/wiki/Manual#RPKM_saturation.py"&gt;&lt;code&gt;RPKM_saturation.py&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: The precision of any sample statitics (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;RPKM&lt;/span&gt;) is affected by sample size (sequencing depth); “resampling” or “jackknifing” is a method to estimate the precision of sample statistics by using subsets of available data. This module will resample a series of subsets from total &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RNA&lt;/span&gt; reads and then calculate &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RPKM&lt;/span&gt; value using each subset. By doing this we are able to check if the current sequencing depth was saturated or not (or if the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RPKM&lt;/span&gt; values were stable or not) in terms of genes&amp;#8217; expression estimation. If sequencing depth was saturated, the estimated &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RPKM&lt;/span&gt; value will be stationary or reproducible. By default, this module will calculate 20 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RPKM&lt;/span&gt; values (using 5%, 10%, &amp;hellip; , 95%,100% of total reads) for each transcripts. Although people can use &lt;span class="caps"&gt;KPSS&lt;/span&gt; test to determine if the estimated &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RPKM&lt;/span&gt; level is in stationary or not. Visual inspection is more&amp;nbsp;accurate.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Genome-wide coverage of all samples, visualized by a &lt;a href="http://circos.ca"&gt;Circos&lt;/a&gt; plot. The example only includes reads mapped to chromosome 9, so the example plot only shows coverage from chromosome&amp;nbsp;9.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Transcript counts, counted by two methods:  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;BEDTools, via &lt;code&gt;bedtools coverage&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;HTSeq, via &lt;code&gt;htseq-count&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Differential Expression analysis, by &lt;code&gt;DESeq&lt;/code&gt; (in the &lt;code&gt;R&lt;/code&gt; programming language). This include gene lists and heat maps.  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Other differential expression methods (NOISeq, DEXSeq) are in the&amp;nbsp;works&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;(Not yet: Structural Variant detection, e.g. of fusion genes via&amp;nbsp;SVDetect)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;   &lt;h1&gt;Input files: A thorough&amp;nbsp;description&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Output&amp;nbsp;directory&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;This is where all the results files will be.

You&amp;rsquo;re not done&amp;nbsp;yet!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You need to remove the first line, the header of the file that explains what is in which&amp;nbsp;column.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;You could do this in Microsoft Excel, but the human file (for example) has 80,923 lines in it and will crash Excel. For organisms with fewer documented genes, using Excel to push columns around may be just&amp;nbsp;fine.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;The Linux/&lt;span class="caps"&gt;UNIX&lt;/span&gt; (lovingly called &amp;ldquo;*&lt;span class="caps"&gt;NIX&lt;/span&gt;&amp;rdquo;) commands to take columns is called &amp;ldquo;cut&amp;rdquo; (there is also &amp;ldquo;paste&amp;rdquo; to put together columns from different files but that&amp;rsquo;s out of the scope of what we&amp;rsquo;re doing here) We want columns 1 and 5 (the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;UCSC&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ID&lt;/span&gt; and the gene symbol &amp;ndash; take a peek at the file by typing &lt;code&gt;head hg19_kgXref.txt&lt;/code&gt; on the command line in the directory &amp;ndash; this will show the first 10 lines of the file), so we&amp;rsquo;ll say &lt;code&gt;cut -f 1,5&lt;/code&gt; where the &lt;code&gt;-f&lt;/code&gt; indicates the &amp;ldquo;fields&amp;rdquo; we want to &lt;code&gt;cut&lt;/code&gt;. Then we use &lt;code&gt;sed 1d&lt;/code&gt; to skip the first line (skipping more than one line has a slighly different command, check out &lt;a href="http://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sed.html"&gt;my favorite Sed tutorial&lt;/a&gt; if you&amp;rsquo;re interested in learning more). And the &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&lt;/code&gt; indicates the input file, the &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt; indicates that the output of the previous command is treated as input to the next command, and the &lt;code&gt;&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; indicates the output file. Note that we created a &lt;em&gt;new&lt;/em&gt; file and did not overwrite the old one. In general, it is best practices to create a new file rather than overwrite the old one. Also, if you try to make your input and output files the same, the commands may get confused and you could lose your original data.&amp;nbsp;:(&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="CodeRay"&gt; &lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;$ cut -f 1,5 &amp;lt; hg19_kgXref.txt | sed 1d &amp;gt; hg19_id_symbol.txt&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Or, if you want to create a chromosome-specific file like I did, use your &lt;code&gt;.bed&lt;/code&gt; file to search through your kgXref&amp;nbsp;file:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="CodeRay"&gt; &lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;$ cut -f 4 hg19_ucsc_genes_chr9.bed | grep --fixed-strings - hg19_kgXref.txt &amp;gt;hg19_kgXref_chr9.txt&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;Then do the same as above, but with your chr9&amp;nbsp;file:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="CodeRay"&gt; &lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;$ cut -f 1,5 &amp;lt; hg19_kgXref_chr9.txt | sed 1d &amp;gt; hg19_id_symbol_chr9.txt&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;h2&gt;Genome&amp;nbsp;file&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;li&gt; Example file:&amp;nbsp;`test-data/human.hg19.genome`&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul

&lt;p&gt;First few lines of example&amp;nbsp;file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Besides the example files, you can also use ones shipped with BEDTools. On my machine, these files are located in &lt;code&gt;~/packages/BEDTools/genomes&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="CodeRay"&gt; &lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;$ ls ~/packages/BEDTools-Version-2.16.2/genomes/ human.hg18.genome human.hg19.genome mouse.mm8.genome  mouse.mm9.genome&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p&gt;As to how to create these files for non-mouse or human organisms, my suggestion (while rather unwieldy) is&amp;nbsp;to:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;Go to &lt;a href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables"&gt;http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgTables&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Choose your clade and organism of&amp;nbsp;interest&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Choose these settings:  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;group: &amp;ldquo;All&amp;nbsp;Tables&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;table:&amp;nbsp;&amp;ldquo;chromInfo&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;output format: &amp;ldquo;all fields from selected&amp;nbsp;table&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;output file: (anything you want, but preferably something informative like&amp;nbsp;platypus.ornAna1.genome)&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Press &amp;ldquo;get&amp;nbsp;output&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Remove the first line and the third column of the file, which you could do in Microsoft Excel (since this file will be comparatively small), or by using this shell command: &lt;code&gt;$ cut -f 1,2 &amp;lt; platypus.ornAna1.genome | sed 1d &amp;gt; platypus.ornAna1.genome.fixed&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;   &lt;h2&gt;Karyotype&amp;nbsp;file&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;What: Another &amp;ldquo;this is how long all the chromosomes are&amp;rdquo; file, but formatted so Circos can use&amp;nbsp;it&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Used by:&amp;nbsp;Circos&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Example file: &lt;code&gt;test-data/karyotype/karyotype.human.hg19.txt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;   &lt;p&gt;This file looks&amp;nbsp;like:&lt;/p&gt;  

&lt;div class="CodeRay"&gt; &lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Karyotype file used by Circos, which specifies the chromosome lengths. The third column, the chromosome name, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MUST&lt;/span&gt; use &lt;code&gt;chr1&lt;/code&gt;-type notation, and not the typical &lt;code&gt;hs1&lt;/code&gt; notation for Homo sapiens chromosome 1. This is because &lt;code&gt;bedtools&lt;/code&gt; and friends use &lt;code&gt;chr1&lt;/code&gt; notation, but I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to require the organism name and then lookup the conversion. Presumably, you would have samples from all the same organism since you are comparing gene expression and coverage across different treatments, so I felt this was a safe assumption. I also didn&amp;rsquo;t want to lock you into &lt;span class="caps"&gt;ONLY&lt;/span&gt; using human data, because there are plenty of interesting organisms out&amp;nbsp;there.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GC&lt;/span&gt; Content&amp;nbsp;file&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;What: Percentage of Guanine and Cytosine (&lt;span class="caps"&gt;GC&lt;/span&gt;) bases per some distance (I recommend at least 1000 bases, or else it will take a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;VERY&lt;/span&gt; long time to plot). This is an important quantity because the &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GC&lt;/span&gt; base pairing has three hydrogen bonds instead of two like &lt;span class="caps"&gt;AT&lt;/span&gt;, is known to be a stronger bond, and genes are also known to be &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GC&lt;/span&gt;-rich.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Used by:&amp;nbsp;Circos&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Example file: &lt;code&gt;test-data/hg19_gc_content_circos_chr9.txt&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;   &lt;p&gt;First few lines of example&amp;nbsp;file:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GC&lt;/span&gt; content file can be created by converting a &lt;code&gt;.wig&lt;/code&gt; (wiggle) format file that&amp;rsquo;s used for a genome browser into a circus format&amp;nbsp;using:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="CodeRay"&gt; &lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;../scripts/wig_to_circos.R hg19_gc1000Base.txt hg19_gc_content.circos&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;h2&gt;Number of&amp;nbsp;bunches&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;What: Merges samples of the same group, e.g. &lt;em&gt;untreated&lt;/em&gt; into &amp;ldquo;bunches,&amp;rdquo; or mergings of several samples.  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;For example, in the example data provided, there are four samples of the LNCaP prostate cancer cell line, and two of the PrEC prostate cancer cell&amp;nbsp;line.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;In the provided example, two bunches are specified. This means that in addition to calculating the gene counts for &lt;code&gt;LNCaP_1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;LNCaP_2&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;LNCaP_3&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;LNCaP_4&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PrEC_1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;PrEC_2&lt;/code&gt;, the pipeline will also create  &lt;ul&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;LNCaP_bunch1of2&lt;/code&gt;, containing &lt;code&gt;LNCaP_1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;LNCaP_2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;LNCaP_bunch2of2&lt;/code&gt;, containing &lt;code&gt;LNCaP_3&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;LNCaP_4&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;PrEC_bunch1of2&lt;/code&gt;, containing &lt;code&gt;PrEC_1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;PrEC_bunch2of2&lt;/code&gt;, containing &lt;code&gt;PrEC_2&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why this is useful:&lt;/strong&gt; Originally, this pipeline was written for single-cell &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RNA&lt;/span&gt;-Seq analysis and we found that while it is very interesting to look at the genes expressed in a single cell, we saw significantly more signal by merging treatment groups into bunches, and performing differential expression analysis on these&amp;nbsp;bunches.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Used by: Entire&amp;nbsp;pipeline&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Example:&amp;nbsp;2&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ul&gt;   &lt;p&gt;To change the ordering of samples, change the conditions file, as that is the basis of the bunching&amp;nbsp;order.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;If you don&amp;rsquo;t want &lt;strong&gt;any&lt;/strong&gt; bunches, omit this variable from the command&amp;nbsp;line.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;h1&gt;Dependencies&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;p&gt;These are programs you must have installed before attempting to run the code. Note: This may seem like a lot, but if you are in biomedical research, it is likely that the servers at your institution already have most of these&amp;nbsp;installed.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.python.org/getit/releases/2.7/"&gt;Python 2.7&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; for RSeQC and HTSeq, #2 and #3  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.cython.org/#download"&gt;Cython&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; required for pybedtools&amp;nbsp;below&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://packages.python.org/pybedtools/"&gt;pybedtools&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; required for&amp;nbsp;HTSeq&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq/doc/overview.html"&gt;HTSeq&lt;/a&gt; &amp;ndash; Another method of calculating gene expression counts, in addition to BEDTools Coverage. Installed via python2.7, i.e. instead of typing &lt;code&gt;python setup.py install&lt;/code&gt; Say: &lt;code&gt;python2.7 setup.py install&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/rseqc/downloads/list"&gt;RSeQC, Version 2.3 or later&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;span class="caps"&gt;RNA&lt;/span&gt;-Sequencing Quality Control&amp;nbsp;software&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://code.google.com/p/bedtools/downloads/list"&gt;BEDTools&lt;/a&gt;, version 2.16.2 or&amp;nbsp;greater&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;Perl 5.8.x or newer (for Circos, #6) Linux and Mac users: &lt;a href="http://www.perl.org/get.html"&gt;http://www.perl.org/get.html&lt;/a&gt; Windows users: &lt;a href="http://strawberryperl.com/"&gt;http://strawberryperl.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://circos.ca"&gt;Circos&lt;/a&gt;, version 0.60 or later (for plotting genome coverage data) Note: Circos has a number of Perl package dependencies that take some time to make sure they are all properly installed on your system. &lt;code&gt;http://circos.ca/software/download/circos&lt;/code&gt; Aliased such that &lt;code&gt;circos&lt;/code&gt; will run the program On my machine, this is accomplished by adding this line to the file in &lt;code&gt;/Users/olgabotvinnik/.bashrc&lt;/code&gt;, or my &lt;code&gt;~/.bashrc&lt;/code&gt; file: &lt;code&gt;PATH=$PATH:/usr/bin/circos/bin ; export PATH&lt;/code&gt; Which means that when you run commands, the computer will know to look in &lt;code&gt;/usr/bin/circos/bin&lt;/code&gt; for potential executable files. /usr/bin/circos Is where I personally installed Circos. On the server that I use, for example, it is installed in: &lt;code&gt;/share/apps/circos-0.60/bin&lt;/code&gt; So then my &lt;code&gt;~/.bashrc&lt;/code&gt; file on the server looks like: &lt;code&gt;PATH=$PATH:/share/apps/circos-0.60/bin ; export PATH&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.r-project.org/"&gt;R, 2.14.2 or later&lt;/a&gt;  &lt;ol&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/DESeq/"&gt;DESeq&lt;/a&gt;. For differential expression&amp;nbsp;analysis.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://bioinfo.cipf.es/noiseq/doku.php?id=downloads"&gt;NOISeq&lt;/a&gt;. Another type of differential expression analysis software. You don&amp;rsquo;t need to download this as it is included in this software, but I figured I should mention&amp;nbsp;it.&lt;/li&gt; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href="http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/DEXSeq.html"&gt;DEXSeq&lt;/a&gt;. Differential exon usage&amp;nbsp;analysis&lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &lt;/ol&gt;   &lt;h1&gt;How to run the example&amp;nbsp;code&lt;/h1&gt;  &lt;h2&gt;Before running, make sure you have everything in&amp;nbsp;place&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;Before running, make sure you add these to your path: &lt;code&gt;python2.7&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;BEDTools&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;SAMTools&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;RSeQC&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;python2.7&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;For example, for me, these are the locations of these packages on my computer. Add these lines, modified to the locations on your computer, below to your &lt;code&gt;~/.bashrc&lt;/code&gt; file and then &amp;ldquo;source&amp;rdquo; it: &lt;code&gt;source ~/.bashrc&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;span class="caps"&gt;FYI&lt;/span&gt;: the colon character, &amp;ldquo;:&amp;rdquo; is the delimiter between places to look for binary executables&amp;nbsp;files.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="CodeRay"&gt; &lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;export PATH=/usr/local/bin/python2.7:$PATH export PATH=$PATH:/share/apps/samtools-0.1.18:/share/apps/BEDTools-Version-2.15.0/ export PYTHONPATH=/share/apps/RSeQC/usr/local/lib/python2.7/site-packages:$PYTHONPATH export PATH=/share/apps/RSeQC/usr/local/bin:$PATH&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;h2&gt;The example&amp;nbsp;run&lt;/h2&gt;  &lt;p&gt;An example run looks like this (yes it is a very long&amp;nbsp;command):&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class="CodeRay"&gt; &lt;div class="code"&gt;&lt;pre&gt;scripts/pipeline.sh test-results test-data/conditions_chr9.tab test-data/hg19_ucsc_genes.gtf test-data/hg19_ucsc_genes_chr9_dexseq.gtf test-data/hg19_ucsc_genes.bed test-data/hg19_id_symbol.txt test-data/human.hg19.genome test-data/karyotype/karyotype.human.hg19.txt test-data/hg19_gene_density_1e5bins.txt test-data/hg19_gc_content_circos_chr9.txt 2&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;

margin: 0px; color: #000000;"&gt;Overton Prize&lt;/a&gt;, which honors the contributions of early-career computational biologists, typically those who are within 3-5 years of their first professorship, and are typically untenured. This year, the Overton prize winner is&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.iscb.org/iscb-awards/1224" style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000;"&gt;Ziv Bar-Joseph&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zivbj/" style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; color: #000000;"&gt;assistant professor at Carnegie-Mellon University&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and avid&amp;nbsp;runner.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p1" style="padding: 0px; margin: 15px 0px 18px; color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; text-align: justify;"&gt;Bar-Joseph&amp;#8217;s love of running is often mentioned in his talks, but I think it is extremely relevant to his career as a scientist. He has the dedication to run nearly every day&amp;nbsp;&lt;em style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"&gt;and&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;have a very substantial research portfolio. In short, Bar-Joseph has mastered the art of balancing life and&amp;nbsp;work.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p1" style="padding: 0px; margin: 15px 0px 18px; color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; text-align: justify;"&gt;To encourage young scientists, he analogized his success to a 50-mile run he recently finished. He showed the racecourse and a photo of himself smiling with an age-group award, saying that his smiling face doesn&amp;#8217;t tell the whole story. Just as when you see the CVs of people who win awards like the Overton, you see an intimidating list of papers, accolades, and accomplishments. But a &lt;span class="caps"&gt;CV&lt;/span&gt; is just the end&amp;nbsp;result.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p1" style="padding: 0px; margin: 15px 0px 18px; color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; text-align: justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p2" style="padding: 0px; margin: 15px 0px 18px; color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; font-size: medium;"&gt;&lt;strong style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"&gt;What happened along the&amp;nbsp;way?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p1" style="padding: 0px; margin: 15px 0px 18px; color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; text-align: justify;"&gt;He then showed a photo of himself at the 20-mile mark, looking decidedly unhappy. He said, &amp;#8220;there is struggle that you do not see when you just see the end the final results.&amp;#8221; He had lost his glasses at the beginning of the race, so he could not see the signposts he was supposed to follow. So he wandered around for five miles without knowing where he was, and then he finally hit the 20-mile mark and realized he had wandered around fruitlessly. Frustrated, but he persevered and went on to win his age&amp;nbsp;category.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p1" style="padding: 0px; margin: 15px 0px 18px; color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; text-align: justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p1" style="padding: 0px; margin: 15px 0px 18px; color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; text-align: justify;"&gt;&lt;span style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px; font-size: medium;"&gt;&lt;strong style="padding: 0px; margin: 0px;"&gt;Perseverance, or &amp;#8220;Stick-to-it-ive-ness&amp;#8221; as my middle school teacher called&amp;nbsp;it&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p1" style="padding: 0px; margin: 15px 0px 18px; color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; text-align: justify;"&gt;His message was simple: perseverance.&amp;nbsp;Maybe you have a similar experience in your past, present, or future, where you thought you were getting somewhere only to realize later on that time was wasted. But in reality, it wasn&amp;#8217;t wasted. Those extra five miles Bar-Joseph ran made him stronger for the next race, and those few months (or years) you spent mastering a technique taught you diligence and patience, skills that will serve you far better than any single&amp;nbsp;technique.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p2" style="padding: 0px; margin: 15px 0px 18px; color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; text-align: justify;"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p1" style="padding: 0px; margin: 15px 0px 18px; color: #333333; font-family: Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif; font-size: 14px; line-height: 22px; text-align: justify;"&gt;More on Bar-Joseph and his fellow Overton Prize colleagues&amp;nbsp;soon.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content></entry><entry><title>How to be fabulously successful: Eric Lander</title><link href="/blog/2012/01/11/2012-01-11-how-to-be-fabulously-successful-eric-lander/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2012-01-11T16:01:00-08:00</published><updated>2012-01-11T16:01:00-08:00</updated><author><name>sciencemeetproductivity</name></author><id>tag:None,2012-01-11:/blog/2012/01/11/2012-01-11-how-to-be-fabulously-successful-eric-lander/</id><summary type="html">&lt;div class='posterous_autopost'&gt;&lt;p&gt;Eric Lander, the visionary behind the &lt;a href="http://www.ornl.gov/sci/techresources/Human_Genome/project/about.shtml"&gt;Human Genome Project&lt;/a&gt;, a Professor of Biology at &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MIT&lt;/span&gt; and Systems Biology at Harvard, recipient of a MacArthur &amp;#8220;genius&amp;#8221; grant, and director of a world-renowned &lt;a href="http://www.broadinstitute.org/"&gt;genome research institute&lt;/a&gt;, was recently&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/03/science/broad-institute-director-finds-power-in-numbers.html?pagewanted=all"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;interviewed&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;for the New York Times newspaper.

As a computational biologist and an avid fan of his, I devoured the article and hungrily watched the video interview. His story is remarkable: genius mathematician, frustrated with the solitude of mathematics, stumbles upon biology and changes the field forever by applying math to understand genes and&amp;nbsp;disease.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p1"&gt;At first, it seems like bunch of chance circumstances that are completely unique to Prof. Lander, such as teaching economics at Harvard, exposing him to a brilliant scientific community that supported his endeavors in biology. Or happening&lt;span style="font-size: small;"&gt; to atten&lt;/span&gt;d the one talk at the one conference where the idea of mapping all the genes in the human genome was first suggested. But if I aim to someday impact bioinformatics research at the same level as Lander, I want to know exactly what he did, day by day, to accomplish all that he has. So I delved&amp;nbsp;deeper.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: medium;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Be stubborn through&amp;nbsp;struggle&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p2"&gt;Watch the below interview with Eric Lander from the New York Times (&lt;a href="http://video.nytimes.com/video/2012/01/02/science/100000001255558/eric-lander.html"&gt;link&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;iframe scrolling="no" marginheight="0" marginwidth="0" src="http://graphics8.nytimes.com/bcvideo/1.0/iframe/embed.html?videoId=100000001255558&amp;amp;playerType=embed" frameborder="0" height="373" width="480"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Lander emphasizes the social aspect of science, which as a computational biologist, a field which is defined as an intersection of disciplines, I wholeheartedly support&amp;nbsp;collaboration&amp;nbsp;as an integral part of modern science. However, I want to highlight what he said at the end (emphasis&amp;nbsp;mine):&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;A lot of times in my life, when I&amp;#8217;ve been casting about, trying to figure out what&amp;#8217;s the next step, what&amp;#8217;s bothering me, where to go. In a way, it&amp;#8217;s not so different from working on a math problem, where if you try to take it head on, you usually can&amp;#8217;t make progress. But when you take on a challenge like &amp;#8216;what do I want to go do now?&amp;#8217; or &amp;#8216;what&amp;#8217;s the field got to do right now?&amp;#8217; or &amp;#8216;what&amp;#8217;s the big issue in cancer,&amp;#8217; whatever.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;You keep struggling with it, and eventually, the structure of the problem becomes clear&lt;/strong&gt;. And then &lt;strong&gt;the path through it becomes clear&lt;/strong&gt;. But all those &lt;strong&gt;moments of insight come from long periods of casting about and seeing all the pieces&lt;/strong&gt;. You just have to be &lt;strong&gt;patient enough to wait until all the pieces really come together&lt;/strong&gt;. You gotta be&amp;nbsp;stubborn.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p1"&gt;This last note is exactly what I mean by &amp;#8220;constancy and moderation.&amp;#8221;&lt;strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/strong&gt;Here is a man who is, by all standards, is a genius. And yet he describes &lt;strong&gt;struggling&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;with a problem. Really getting to know it, spending time with this problem and thinking about all its parts. This can be done alone or collaboratively, but the struggle must happen.&amp;nbsp;In &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Outliers-Story-Success-Malcolm-Gladwell/dp/0316017922"&gt;Outliers&lt;/a&gt; by Malcolm Gladwell, he discussed case studies of seemingly chance successes only to uncover the pattern of consistent opportunities to practice. For example, the Beatles performed&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;eight hours a night&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;at a club in Hamburg, Germany. Eight hours! Before, they had prepared an hour&amp;#8217;s worth of material for gigs and initially, the group struggled to find enough to play for such a long period of time. These huge stretches forced the group to constantly change their sound and have long, dynamic set lists to keep their audience engaged. They struggled through eight hour set lists and eventually became the legendary band they are&amp;nbsp;today.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Cal Newport,&amp;nbsp;author of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Study Hacks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, has written about&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://calnewport.com/blog/2009/06/22/on-the-value-of-hard-focus/"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;the value of hard focus&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;such as this, which&amp;nbsp;Lander exemplifies in his description of struggle.&amp;nbsp;As a result of his struggles, Lander attained huge amounts of practice in mathematics as evidenced by his high school math team and leading up to his doctorate in mathematics, which qualified him to teach at an major research institution such as Harvard and be surrounded by experts in every possible discipline. &lt;strong&gt;The &amp;#8220;chance circumstances&amp;#8221; Lander experienced were as a result of his grit and persistence through&amp;nbsp;mathematics.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p1"&gt;And then, there are some &lt;strong&gt;moments of insight&lt;/strong&gt;, which come from these struggles, come from putting in the time and energy onto a problem. The Beatles improvised, invented, and found their sound that led to them to become one of the most successful and prolific bands of all time. Lander worked with colleagues to invent new methods of analyzing biological&amp;nbsp;information.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: medium;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Have a reasonable&amp;nbsp;workday&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Let&amp;#8217;s dig deeper into how he actually accomplishes this. From&amp;nbsp;the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/03/science/broad-institute-director-finds-power-in-numbers.html?pagewanted=all"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;accompanying article&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, Lander&amp;#8217;s workday doesn&amp;#8217;t seem so&amp;nbsp;remarkable:&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;After his morning workout, he sometimes goes to a local bakery where he can work quietly. He arrives at the Broad between 8 and 10 a.m. In the fall, he teaches introductory biology to a class of 700 &lt;span class="caps"&gt;M.I.T.&lt;/span&gt; students on Monday, Wednesday and Friday mornings. He often meets with graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in the afternoon to discuss their&amp;nbsp;work.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;Then he has his administrative duties and his meetings with philanthropists, trying to raise more money. He also spends 20 percent of his time in yet another role, as co-chairman of President Obama&amp;rsquo;s Council of Advisers on Science and Technology, which deals with topics like influenza vaccines, health information technology, science education and energy&amp;nbsp;policy.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p1" style="padding-left: 30px;"&gt;In the evening, around 6:30 or 7, he has dinner with his&amp;nbsp;family.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p1"&gt;So how does he accomplish such remarkable things? Despite the apparent normality of this schedule, it has several&amp;nbsp;gems.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span style="font-size: medium;"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Hard focus&amp;nbsp;first&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p1"&gt;First,&amp;nbsp;I&amp;#8217;m guessing he uses the morning bakery time to &amp;#8220;&lt;em&gt;work quietly&amp;#8221;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;on his hardest task. The one where he must make a creative leap from old paradigms to new ideas, which requires a great deal of focus and energy. This is in line with Leo Babauta,&amp;nbsp;author of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://zenhabits.net/"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;Zen Habits&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, advises to work on your&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://zenhabits.net/tada/"&gt;&lt;span class="s1"&gt;most important thing&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;first thing in the morning, before any interruptions might come up.&amp;nbsp;Lander does exactly this. He could be&amp;nbsp;writing a manuscript, thinking about a problem that a graduate student proposed, or preparing a brand-new lecture.&amp;nbsp;He&amp;#8217;s refreshed after his morning workout and probably getting some calories and caffeine - a great recipe for&amp;nbsp;focus.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p1"&gt;In any case, Lander&amp;#8217;s definitely not checking his facebook or email first thing in the morning. And if you want to be successful like Eric Lander, you shouldn&amp;#8217;t,&amp;nbsp;either.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Second, he then does less &amp;#8220;hard focus&amp;#8221; tasks. He then teaches, which is probably building from his many previous lessons, so he&amp;#8217;s well prepared. Then he meets with graduate students/post-docs/collaborators, which is certainly intellectually stimulating but probably doesn&amp;#8217;t require quite as much energy as his morning task. If him and his colleagues hit a wall, he can always think about it in the next morning or meet up again&amp;nbsp;later.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Finally, he gets some rest. He finishes his day at a reasonable time and has dinner with his family. Connecting with his family stimulates his social mind and rejuvenates his analytical brain. He doesn&amp;#8217;t expect to work late into the night, because he knows he already accomplished his most important thing in the morning. He touched base with his graduate students and connected with his&amp;nbsp;colleagues.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Day by day, and little by little, Lander builds his success through daily focus, struggle, and he does it for those moments of insight that transform a field forever. And that&amp;#8217;s what I&amp;#8217;ll be&amp;nbsp;doing.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><category term="advice"></category><category term="bioinformatics"></category><category term="case study"></category><category term="computational biology"></category><category term="eric lander"></category><category term="hard focus"></category><category term="most important thing"></category><category term="productivity"></category></entry><entry><title>Constancy and moderation wins the race</title><link href="/blog/2011/12/23/2011-12-23-constancy-and-moderation-wins-the-race/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-12-23T09:14:00-08:00</published><updated>2011-12-23T09:14:00-08:00</updated><author><name>sciencemeetproductivity</name></author><id>tag:None,2011-12-23:/blog/2011/12/23/2011-12-23-constancy-and-moderation-wins-the-race/</id><summary type="html">&lt;div class='posterous_autopost'&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class='p_embed p_image_embed'&gt; &lt;a href="http://getfile6.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2011-12-22/HFmhvHlyxeGHCaBnvqpDexicIlvnupvBlevkegqdIDGtdhenctvuwydhehoB/the_tortoise_and_the_hare.jpeg.scaled1000.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="The_tortoise_and_the_hare" height="500" src="http://getfile8.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2011-12-22/HFmhvHlyxeGHCaBnvqpDexicIlvnupvBlevkegqdIDGtdhenctvuwydhehoB/the_tortoise_and_the_hare.jpeg.scaled500.jpg" width="500" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;span style="color: #888888;"&gt;Photo credit:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/esoule/2439356229/"&gt;esoule&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p&gt;  &lt;p class="p3"&gt;As a first year graduate student reading&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Advice-Faculty-Members-Robert-Boice/dp/0205281591"&gt;&lt;span class="s3"&gt;Advice for New Faculty&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;by Robert Boice,&amp;nbsp;you may think I&amp;#8217;m getting ahead of myself since I have a long way to go before I become Professor Olga.

But besides advice for the ivory tower, this book has great&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;life&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;advice. This guy is a psychologist and spent years studying exemplary new faculty and what sets them apart. The book emphasizes &amp;#8220;&lt;strong&gt;constancy and moderation&lt;/strong&gt;,&amp;#8221; essentially &amp;#8220;slow and steady wins the&amp;nbsp;race.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p3"&gt;The originator of &amp;#8220;slow and steady wins the race&amp;#8221; is Aesop&amp;#8217;s fable &amp;#8220;The Tortoise and the Hare.&amp;#8221; The Tortoise puts in steady work, constantly working a little bit towards the goal. The Hare, on the other hand, procrastinates until the last minute and is forced to sprint to a low-quality product&amp;mdash;losing the race when the Hare is clearly the faster&amp;nbsp;runner.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Like many of us, I sympathize with the hare. When faced with a new project I think to myself, &amp;#8220;I&amp;#8217;m smart. I could finish this in a night.&amp;#8221; I procrastinate until a few days before, then rush to get everything done, realizing the project was much bigger than I thought, and I end up with a B- on something I could have earned&amp;nbsp;A+.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p3"&gt;As a nerd, I love data and graphs and what struck me about &lt;span class="s2"&gt;Advice for New Faculty&lt;/span&gt; were the charts of input and output of &amp;#8220;exemplary quick-starting&amp;#8221; new faculty and their less exemplary peers, shown in &lt;em&gt;Figure 15.2&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;below. The &amp;#8220;quick-starting&amp;#8221; faculty (labeled &lt;em&gt;Moderates&lt;/em&gt;) worked consistently on writing throughout the week and produced many more pages of writing per week than their peers (labeled &lt;em&gt;Romantics&lt;/em&gt;). These less productive faculty romanticized the impulsiveness of binges, ie misguided statements such as &amp;#8220;True genius is inspired,&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;&amp;#8220;I have to wait until the perfect moment to work,&amp;#8221; &amp;#8220;That&amp;#8217;s what divine madness&amp;nbsp;means.&amp;#8221;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;div class='p_embed p_image_embed'&gt; &lt;a href="http://getfile4.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2011-12-23/jBpddgyDFGmvisEJuGiICxzhBnAwpCDcGhbrFwfbhDgDsJbtCtgrADEobByc/Photo_Dec_21_17_19_18.jpg.scaled1000.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Photo_dec_21_17_19_18" height="460" src="http://getfile3.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2011-12-23/jBpddgyDFGmvisEJuGiICxzhBnAwpCDcGhbrFwfbhDgDsJbtCtgrADEobByc/Photo_Dec_21_17_19_18.jpg.scaled500.jpg" width="500" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class='p_embed p_image_embed'&gt; &lt;a href="http://getfile1.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2011-12-23/eskncBeJjczGgongeHyuItpFFmvDzHxdChvroFhaCpfIchkkmAxymrDDCqEv/Photo_Dec_21_17_19_38.jpg.scaled1000.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="Photo_dec_21_17_19_38" height="427" src="http://getfile7.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2011-12-23/eskncBeJjczGgongeHyuItpFFmvDzHxdChvroFhaCpfIchkkmAxymrDDCqEv/Photo_Dec_21_17_19_38.jpg.scaled500.jpg" width="500" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;   &lt;p class="p3"&gt;How does this affect me, and more importantly, you? Boice suggests tackling difficult tasks such as writing in&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;brief, daily sessions&lt;/em&gt; (BDSs) lasting as few as 15 minutes and as many as 90 minutes. &lt;strong&gt;Why brief?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Brevity is essential as you work while you are fresh and able, not until you&amp;#8217;re exhausted (see:&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://blog.olgabotvinnik.com/glamorized-exhaustion-is-not-productivity"&gt;&lt;span class="s3"&gt;glamorized exhaustion&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;).&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;Why daily?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;By working on your projects daily, you keep them fresh in your mind and which allows connections to appear, almost&amp;nbsp;effortlessly.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p3"&gt;But BDSs apply to more than just writing. They are perfect for your most paralyzing activity, the activity&amp;nbsp;or task you know you have to do but you can&amp;#8217;t seem to muster the motivation.&amp;nbsp;Ask yourself:&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;what is my most paralyzing activity?&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;For computer scientists, it could be the [intolerable] biology class. For biologists, it could be the dreaded calculus homework. It could be learning a new programming language, writing your thesis, exercising, or mastering an instrument. For me, it&amp;#8217;s PhD and fellowship&amp;nbsp;applications.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Next, &lt;strong&gt;schedule this activity at your peak time&lt;/strong&gt;. For many people (including myself), this is first thing in the morning. Before you check your email or read your blogs. It doesn&amp;#8217;t have to be for very long, even a focused 15-minute push can greatly advance a project. If you&amp;#8217;re deeper into the project, you could go for as long as 90 minutes. By the time the rest of the world wakes up, you&amp;#8217;ll have accomplished your hardest&amp;nbsp;task.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p3"&gt;Lastly, &lt;strong&gt;begin before feeling ready. &lt;/strong&gt;Before you get that surge of inspiration you&amp;#8217;re waiting for, start putting words or code or brushstrokes down. The inspiration will come as you work. More on this in future&amp;nbsp;posts.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p3"&gt;For example, last quarter I had 5 fellowship applications and 7 PhD school applications to submit with deadlines of November 1st, November 18th, and December 1st. Doesn&amp;#8217;t sound so bad until you see how much writing you have to do. 2000 words for one fellowship, 5000 characters for another.&amp;nbsp;&lt;strong&gt;The amount of writing paralyzed me&lt;/strong&gt;.&amp;nbsp;Of course, I could use materials from finished apps, but first I had to &lt;em&gt;finish&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;them. Over October and November, I worked on my applications every day in the morning. &lt;strong&gt;It was incredibly liberating to know that my paralyzing work was&amp;nbsp;underway.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p3"&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can do this.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;Comment or&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="mailto:olga@olgabotvinnik.com"&gt;&lt;span class="s3"&gt;send me an email&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;about what is your most paralyzing activity, and how you&amp;#8217;re going to fight/combat its influence over&amp;nbsp;you.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><category term="advice"></category><category term="advice for new faculty"></category><category term="BDSs"></category><category term="begin before feeling ready"></category><category term="constancy and moderation"></category></entry><entry><title>Glamorized exhaustion is not productivity</title><link href="/blog/2011/12/14/2011-12-14-glamorized-exhaustion-is-not-productivity/" rel="alternate"></link><published>2011-12-14T13:24:00-08:00</published><updated>2011-12-14T13:24:00-08:00</updated><author><name>sciencemeetproductivity</name></author><id>tag:None,2011-12-14:/blog/2011/12/14/2011-12-14-glamorized-exhaustion-is-not-productivity/</id><summary type="html">&lt;div class='posterous_autopost'&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;div class='p_embed p_image_embed'&gt; &lt;a href="http://getfile4.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2011-12-14/fvtzaEwAnoApEgJmhbmfIJjiiGgvyDoAwqqaHepErAnaGdjDAlbJDoobyvna/2404849371_02a88db594_o.jpg.scaled1000.jpg"&gt;&lt;img alt="2404849371_02a88db594_o" height="317" src="http://getfile4.posterous.com/getfile/files.posterous.com/temp-2011-12-14/fvtzaEwAnoApEgJmhbmfIJjiiGgvyDoAwqqaHepErAnaGdjDAlbJDoobyvna/2404849371_02a88db594_o.jpg.scaled500.jpg" width="500" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;em&gt;Photo courtesy of&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/beforethecoffee/" style="text-decoration: none; color: #0063dc; font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; text-align: left; background-color: #fefefe;"&gt;beforethecoffee&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;MIT&lt;/span&gt; is the epitome of glamorized&amp;nbsp;exhaustion.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve gotten 8 hours of sleep in the past three days,&amp;#8221; they&amp;nbsp;brag.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p1"&gt;&lt;span class="dquo"&gt;&amp;#8220;&lt;/span&gt;Oh yeah?

I&amp;#8217;ve been working on this project for 12 hours&amp;nbsp;nonstop.&amp;#8221;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p1"&gt;But this attitude and work style just isn&amp;#8217;t effective. I&amp;#8217;m determined to change how I work to be more effective and more&amp;nbsp;productive.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p1"&gt;This realization has not come easily.&amp;nbsp;I used to live and breathe exhaustion. In high school, I had days where I had school 7:45am-3:15pm, then crew (rowing - I was a coxswain) practice 4pm-7pm, then orchestra rehearsal until 9pm. Then homework! In undergrad, I double majored in addition to my many activities, and I was constantly&amp;nbsp;tired.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Last year, something changed. I worked at a research institution, focused on the tasks and projects I needed to accomplish, and worked consistently to achieve these goals. I exercised almost daily. I cooked almost all my meals. And I was the most productive I have ever&amp;nbsp;been.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p1"&gt;If a job is easy, what makes the student life so difficult? When you&amp;#8217;re done with your job, you&amp;#8217;re done. Working at home is not necessary, any work you do is bonus points. But as a student, the structure doesn&amp;#8217;t exist. You have classes and deadlines. Go. But to succeed and be happy while you do it, you must create your own&amp;nbsp;schedule.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p1"&gt;University students everywhere cram for their exams, then feel miserable and perform poorly. The problem derives not from mental ability, but a lack of consistent time scheduling to activities. At &lt;span class="caps"&gt;MIT&lt;/span&gt;, a typical course is 12 &amp;#8220;units,&amp;#8221; where a &amp;#8220;unit&amp;#8221; is an hour of work expected per week. An introductory biology course divides its units to 5 in lecture, 0 in lab, and 7 studying at home, or 5-0-7. Why didn&amp;#8217;t I harness this knowledge to plan my week and execute homework with efficient precision? A number of excuses come to mind, I was lazy, I didn&amp;#8217;t feel like starting problem sets so early, but the biggest reason was &lt;strong&gt;that&amp;#8217;s what I always did&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p1"&gt;I could get away with these study habits in high school and do well, but college was a whole different ballgame. Even so, if you walk into the reading room/library before 5pm, you&amp;#8217;ll see nary a soul. But from 7pm on, the desks are packed with people studying at a time where their brain is far too tired. They end up sleeping in the reading room. During the day, these students fill the hallways, glamorizing their exhaustion and out-suffering their friends. It&amp;#8217;s&amp;nbsp;pitiful.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p1"&gt;I&amp;#8217;m determined to change the way students approach work. Instead of bingeing and writing a paper in a 14-hour marathon, mindfully gather your ideas and craft a well-thought essay. Rather than waiting until the last minute to start your programming assignment, prime your mind early on by thinking through the pseudocode and produce a nicely commented&amp;nbsp;program.&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p1"&gt;In my last year of undergrad, I used these strategies increased both my &lt;span class="caps"&gt;GPA&lt;/span&gt; and my relaxation time. Starting early really&amp;nbsp;works!&lt;/p&gt;  &lt;p class="p1"&gt;Next time, I&amp;#8217;ll discuss the book &lt;a href="http://www.amazon.com/Advice-Faculty-Members-Robert-Boice/dp/0205281591"&gt;Advice for New Faculty Members&lt;/a&gt; and why it applies to you, regardless of whether you are in academia or&amp;nbsp;not.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;</content><category term="glamorized exhaustion"></category><category term="MIT"></category><category term="productivity"></category></entry></feed>
